*Here are my notes from a recent talk I gave on vectorization at a
[Davis R Users' Group](http://www.noamross.net/davis-r-users-group.html)
meeting. Thanks to [Vince Buffalo](https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo), [John
Myles White](http://twitter.com/johnmyleswhite), and [Hadley
Wickham](http://twitter.com/hadleywickham) for their input as I was
preparing this. Feedback welcome!*

Beginning R users are often told to "vectorize" their code. Here, I try
to explain *why* vectorization can be advantageous in R by showing how R
works under the hood.

Now, remember, [premature optimization is the root of all evil
(Knuth)](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization). Don't start
re-writing your code unless the time saved is going to be worth the time
invested. [Other approaches, like finding a bigger machine or
parallelization](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/4/25/faster-talk.html),
could give you more bang for the buck in terms of programming time. But
if you understand the nuts and bolts of vectorization in R, it may help
you write shorter, simpler, safer, and yes, faster code in the first
place.

First, let's acknowledge that vectorization can seem like voodoo.
Consider a two math problems, one vectorized, and one not:

<div>$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}$$</div>

<div>$$\begin{aligned}
1 + 1 = 2 \\
2 + 2 = 4 \\
3 + 3 = 6
\end{aligned}$$</div>

Why on earth should these take a different amount of time to calculate?
Linear algebra isn't magic. In both cases there are three addition
operations to perform. So what's up?

1. What on earth is R actually doing?
-------------------------------------

R is a *high-level*, *interpreted* computer language. This means that R
takes care of a lot of basic computer tasks for you. For instance, when
you type

        i <- 5.0

you *don't* have to tell your computer:

-   That "5.0" is a floating-point number
-   That "i" should store numeric-type data
-   To find a place in memory for to put "5"
-   To register "i" as a pointer to that place in memory

You also don't have to convert `i <- 5.0` to binary code. That's done
automatically when you hit 'Enter'.

When you then type

    i <- "foo"

you don't have to tell the computer that `i` no longer stores an integer
but a series of characters that form a *string*, to store "f", "o", and
"o", consecutively, etc.

R figures these things on it's own, on the fly, as you type commands or
source them from a file. This means that running a command in R takes a
*relatively* longer time than it might in a lower-level language, such
as C. If I am writing in C, I might write

    int i
    i = 5

This tells the computer the `i` will store data of the type `int`
(integers), and assign the value 5 to it. If I try to assign 5.5 to it,
something will go wrong. Depending on my set-up, it might throw an
error, or just silently assign 5 to `i`. But C doesn't have to figure
out what type of data is is represented by `i` and this is part of what
makes it faster.

Here's another example. If, in R, you type:

    2L + 3.5

The computer asks:

> "OK, what's the first thing?"
>
> "An integer"
>
> "The second thing?"
>
> "A a floating-point number"
>
> "Do we have a way to deal with adding an integer and a floating-point
> number?"
>
> "Yes! Convert the integer to a floating-point number, then add the two
> floating point numbers"
>
> [converts integer]
>
> [finds a place in memory for the answer]
>
> etc.

If R were a *compiled* computer language, like C or FORTRAN, much of
this "figuring out" would be accomplished during the compilation step, not when
the program was run. Compiled programs are translated into binary
computer language after they are written, but before they are run, and
this occurs over the *whole program*, rather than line-by-line. This
allows the compiler to organize the binary machine code in an optimal
way for the computer to interpret.

What does this have to do with vectorization in R? Well, **many R
functions are actually written in a a compiled language**, such as C,
C++, and FORTRAN, and have a small R "wrapper". For instance, when you
inspect the code for `fft`, the fast Fourier transform, you see

    > fft
    function (z, inverse = FALSE) 
    .Call(C_fft, z, inverse)
    <bytecode: 0x7fc261e1b910>
    <environment: namespace:stats>

R is passing the data onto a C function called `C_fft`. You'll see this
in many R functions. If you look at their source code, it will include
`.C()`, `.Call()`, or sometimes `.Internal()` or `.Primitive()`. These
means R is calling a C, C++, or FORTRAN program to carry out operations.
However, R still has to interpret the input of the function before
passing it to the compiled code. In `fft()` the compiled code runs only
*after* R figures out the data type in `z`, and also whether to use the
default value of `inverse`. The compiled code is able to run faster than
code written in pure R, because the "figuring out" stuff is done first,
and it can zoom ahead without the "translation" steps that R needs.

If you need to run a function over all the values in a vector, you could
pass a whole vector through the R function to the compiled code, or you
could call the R function repeatedly for each value. If you do the
latter, R has to do the "figuring out" stuff, as well as the
translation, *each time*. But if you call it once, with a vector, the
"figuring out" part happens just once.

Inside the C or FORTRAN code, vectors are actually processed using loops
or a similar construct. This is inevitable; somehow the computer is going
to need to operate on each element of your vector. Since this occurs in
the compiled code, though, without the overhead of R functions, this is
much faster.

Another important component of the speed of vectorized operations is
that vectors in R are *typed*. Despite all of its flexibility, R does
have some restrictions on what we can do. All elements of a vector must
be the same data type. If I try to do this

    a <- c(1, 2, FALSE, "hello")

I get

    > a
    [1] "1"     "2"     "FALSE" "hello"
    > class(a)
    [1] "character"

R converts all my data to characters. It can't handle a vector with
different data types.

So when R needs to perform an operation like

    c(1, 2, 3) + c(1, 2, 3)

R only has to ask what types of data are in *each vector* (2) rather
than *each element* (6).

One consequence of all this is that fast R code is short. If you can
express what you want to do in R in a line or two, with just a few
function calls that are actually calling compiled code, it'll be more
efficient than if you write long program, with the added overhead of
many function calls. This is not the case in all other languages. Often,
in compiled languages, you want to stick with lots of very simple
statements, because that allows the compiler to figure out the most
efficient translation of the code.

2. Everything is a vector
-------------------------

In R *everything* is a vector. To quote Tim Smith in ["aRrgh: a
newcomer's (angry) guide to R"](http://tim-smith.us/arrgh/)

> All naked numbers are double-width floating-point atomic vectors of
> length one. You're welcome.

This means that, in R, typing "6" tells R something like

    <start vector, type=numeric, length=1>6<end vector>

While in other languages, "6" might just be

    <numeric>6

So, while in other languages, it might be more efficient to express
something as a single number rather than a length-one vector, in R this
is impossible. There's no *advantage* to NOT organizing your data as
vector. In other languages, short vectors might be better expressed as
scalars.

3. Linear algebra is a special case
-----------------------------------

Linear algebra is one of the core functions of a lot of computing, so
there are highly optimized programs for linear algebra. Such a program
is called a BLAS - basic linear algebra system. R, and a lot of other
software, relies on these specialized programs and outsources linear
algebra to them. A BLAS is generally designed to be highly efficient and has things like
built-in parallel processing, hardware-specific implementation, and a host of other tricks. So if your calculations can be expressed in
actual linear algebra terms, such as matrix multiplication, than it is
almost certainly faster to vectorize them because the BLAS will be doing
most of the heavy lifting.

There are faster and slower linear algebra libraries, and you can
install new ones on your computer and tell R to use them instead of the
defaults. This used to be like putting a new engine in your car, but
[it's gotten considerably
easier](http://moderntoolmaking.blogspot.com/2013/07/for-faster-r-on-mac-use-veclib.html).
For certain problems, a shiny new BLAS can considerably speed up code, but
results vary depending on the specific linear algebra operations you are
using.

4. Functionals: Pre-allocating memory, avoiding side effects.
-------------------------------------------------------------

There are a whole family of functions in R called *functionals*, or
`apply` functions, which take vectors (or matrices, or lists) of values
and apply arbitrary functions to each. Because these can use *arbitrary*
functions, they are NOT compiled. Functionals mostly are written in pure
R, and they speed up code only in certain cases.

One operation that is slow in R, and somewhat slow in all languages, is
memory allocation. So one of the slower ways to write a `for` loop is to
resize a vector repeatedly, so that R has to re-allocate memory
repeatedly, like this:

    j <- 1
    for (i in 1:10) {
        j[i] = 10
    }

Here, in each repetition of the `for` loop, R has to re-size the vector
and re-allocate memory. It has to find the vector in memory, create a
new vector that will fit more data, copy the old data over, insert the
new data, and erase the old vector. This can get very slow as vectors
get big.

If one pre-allocates a vector that fits all the values, R doesn't have
to re-allocate memory each iteration, and the results can be much
faster. Here's how you'd do that for the above case:

    j <- rep(NA, 10)
    for (i in 1:10) {
        j[i] = 10
    }

The `apply` or `plyr::*ply` functions all actually have `for` loops
inside, but they automatically do things like pre-allocating vector size
so you don't screw it up. This is the main reason that they can be
faster.

Another thing that "ply" functions help with is avoiding what are known
as *side effects*. When you run a *ply* function, everything happens
inside that function, and nothing changes in your working environment
(this is known as "functional programming"). In a `for` loop, on the
other hand, when you do something like `for(i in 1:10)`, you get the
leftover `i` in your environment. This is considered bad practice
sometimes. Having a bunch of temporary variables like `i` lying around
could cause problems in your code, especially if you use `i` for
something else later.

I've seen arguments that `ply` functions make for more expressive,
easier to read code, but I've seen the same argument for `for` loops.
Once you are used to writing vectorized code in general, though, `for`
loops in R will can seem odd.

So when might `for` loops make sense over vectorization?
--------------------------------------------------------

There are still situations that it may make sense to use `for` loops
instead of vectorized functions, though. These include:

-   Using functions that don't take vector arguments
-   Loops where each iteration is dependent on the results of previous
    iterations

Note that the second case is tricky. In some cases where the *obvious*
implementation of an algorithm uses a `for` loop, there's a vectorized
way around it. For instance, [here is a good example of implementing a
random walk using vectorized code](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/Taupo-handouts.pdf). In these cases, you often want to call functions
that are essentially C/FORTRAN implementations of loop operations to
avoid the loop in R. Examples of such functions include `cumsum`
(cumulative sums), `rle` (counting number of repeated value), and
`ifelse` (vectorized if...else statements).

Your performance penalty for using a `for` loop instead a vector will be
small if the number of iterations is relatively small, and the functions
called *inside* your for loop are slow. In these cases, looping and
overhead from function calls make up a small fraction of your
computational time. It may make sense to use a `for` loop in such cases,
especially if they are more intuitive or easier to read *for you*.
