      <description>Lauren Yamane talked about Andersen et al. (2004) in our Ecological Stoichiometry course today. Here are her slides, and below, my rough notes on the paper:  Notes on the Paper ------------------ - Stoichiometry is a way of representing food quality - there is evidence that consumers have preference for high quality (e.g., low C:N) food. - There is often a mismatch between composition of prey (autotrophs) and needs of consumers.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow in my stoichiometry seminar I&#39;ll be talking about the dynamics
of growth under multiple nutrient limitation and acclimation. Here are
my notes:

Rastetter and Shaver (1992)
---------------------------

In this paper, Rastetter and Shaver introduce a model of plant growth on
multiple nutrients, with the goal of understanding the conditions under
which single- and multiple-nutrient limitation arise, the difference
between short- and long-term behavior, and the role of</description>

      <description>Pretty raw notes this week from a discussion about how food webs respond to nutrient starvation and excess. ### Whalen on consumption in Food Webs  - Boersma and Elser (2006) - fitness cost of excessive P. Implications for models - but what about competition as a more likely limiting factor? - Not sure about the &#34;food left on the table&#34; argument. - What about the metabolic costs? Not mentioned in the paper.</description>

      <description>My advisor [Alan Hastings](http://two.ucdavis.edu/~me/) and colleague [Alison Marklein](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alison_Marklein/) have put together a great seminar this quarter on theoretical appraoches to nutrient flows and ecological stochiometry. I&#39;m excited because this bridges my own current work, in population modeling, with my undergraduate training in ecosystem- and biogiochemical-based ecology. I&#39;ll try to blog about the papers we read as we go, and I&#39;ve created a public [Mendeley Group](http://www.mendeley.com/groups/2632651/ecological-stoichiometry/papers/) where I&#39;ll be posting the readings.</description>
