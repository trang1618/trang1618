      <description>In [my first pass at text analysis of the ESA program](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2014/7/24/esacorpuscompare.html), I looked at how the frequency of words used in the ESA program differed from last year to this year. There are much more sophisticated ways at looking at word use in text, though, and I began to dive into the text-mining literature to find other ways to draw insight from ESA abstracts. One method I found is *topic modeling* using [latent Dirichlet allocation](http://en.</description>

I decided to collect a little more data by including programs back to 2010, giving a five-year data set. Thankfully the program back to 2010 remains in mostly the same format, so it&#39;s easy to pull the data for these additional years. Now, not all talks that include natural history concepts will include the term &#34;</description>

models (IBMs), where processes at the scale of individual scale of
organisms and their actions are modeled explicitly. Such processes can

than the individual.

IBMs suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The number of possible

      <description>My [first crack at an age-structured disease model with multiple infections](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/6/11/multi-infection-tests.html) yielded the interesting result that one could observe differences in disease rates across age without any actual differences in the biology between old and young individuals. Today I&#39;m trying to answer a different question analytically: does age structure matter for the course of the disease in the whole population? Here&#39;s the model. There are two minor changes: I no longer scale $J$ and $A$ with $K$ in the third and fourth equations; there&#39;s no reason the encounter rate should be tied to carrying capacity.</description>

      <description>How does overdispersion of infections affect the behavior of the [multiple-infection model](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/6/11/multi-infection-tests.html)? I redefine the model to account for overdispersion, assuming the same overdispersion occurs in both age classes. The parameter $k$ varies inversely with the degree of overdispersion. Again, the classes are demographically identical, and infection affects mortality but not growth: $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dJ}{dt} &amp;= A f_A \left(1 - \frac{J+A}{K} \right) + J \left(f_J \left(1 - \frac{J+A}{K} \right) - d_J - g\right) - \alpha P_J \\ \frac{dA}{dt} &amp;= J g - A d_A - \alpha P_A \\ \frac{dP_J}{dt} &amp;= \lambda \frac{J}{K} (P_J + P_A) - P_J \left(d_J + \mu + g + \alpha \left(1 + \frac{(k+1)P_J}{kJ} \right) \right) \\ \frac{dP_A}{dt} &amp;= \lambda \frac{J}{K} (P_J + P_A) + P_J g - PA \left(d_A + \mu + \alpha \left(1 + \frac{(k+1)P_A}{kA} \right) \right) \end{aligned}$$ I define the model and run it in R below, using values of $k$ ranging from 0.</description>

      <description>*Here&#39;s a little thought exercise I did that has caused me to go back and restart my Sudden Oak Death modeling in a new framework. Feedback welcome. I&#39;m especially interested in relevant literature -- I haven&#39;t found many good examples of macroparasite/multiple infection models with age structure.* Introduction ------------ Cobb et al. (2012) develop two models of forest stand demography in the face of Sudden Oak Death. The first, a statistical survival model, estimated the rates of infection and time-to-mortality as functions of density of infected trees and tree size.</description>

      <description>In my [last post](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/4/25/faster-talk.html) I mentioned that I had improved on R&#39;s `summaryRprof()` function with a custom function called `proftable()`. I&#39;ve updated `proftable()` to take advantage of R 3.0.0&#39;s ability to record line numbers while profiling. I&#39;ve put it on github -- you can get it [there](https://github.com/noamross/noamtools/blob/master/R/proftable.R) or below. `proftable` reads in a file generated by `Rprof()` and creates an easy-to read table of the most time-consuming calls in your code, ordered from most time-consuming to least.</description>

There&#39;s too much for a pithy summary here, but some highlights about the disease&#39;s biology: - SOD is caused by *Phytophthora ramorum*, a water mold in the same family as brown algae. It&#39;s origin is unknown, but 3 lineages are known, two dominant in California and one in Europe.</description>

-   Modeling *purpose* must be clearly defined, as this determines
    whether to focus on generality, realisms, and/or precision

pathology. [David Rizzo](http://ucanr.org/sites/rizzolab/) will be
examining me on this topic.

Summary
-------

Much of our knowledge of pathology is at the organismal level
(host-pathogen interactions), but actual management occurs at stand,
forest, and regional levels. To understand and manage forest diseases at
this scale, we need appropriate epidemiological and landscape ecology
tools and frameworks.</description>

Her original scripts can be found as `*.Rmd` files [here](https://gist.github.com/4197507) A note to UC Davis students: This topic and others will be covered by Marissa Baskett and Sebastian Schreiber in their course this winter, *Computational methods in population biology* (ECL298) * * * * * A discrete time, age-structured model of a salmon population (semelparous) that can live to age 5, with fishing and environmental stochasticity ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Parameter values ~~~~ {.</description>

      <description>This is a description of the model I&#39;ve implemented in the [SODDr
package](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2012/11/16/sod-dynamics-1.html),
which I prepared for a presentation for the Hastings lab meeting on
November 29, 2012.

Background
----------

[Sudden Oak Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_oak_death) (SOD)
is a disease that threatens tanoak populations in California. It&#39;s cause
is an introduced pathogen, *Phytophthora ramorum*. *Phytophthora* is a
water mold that spreads by wind-blown rain and fog as well as through</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been hunting for a lightweight CSV editor for OSX so I could to make fixes to data files and not need to fire up Excel. While you can edit a CSV file in any text editor, it&#39;s a pain to navigate the files without a spreadsheet-like interface. Unfortunately [there doesn&#39;t seem to be a good, free option out there](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/66214/are-there-any-free-and-lightweight-spreadsheet-programs-for-the-mac). Today I remembered R has a native XCode editor for editing data frames, and I realized I could write a function that would load the CSV as a data frame, let me edit it, then close and save it in CSV format again.</description>

      <description>I am working on a project with the [Rizzo Lab](http://ucanr.edu/sites/rizzolab/) examining the dynamics of Sudden Oak Death (SOD). I really have to write more about this, but today I&#39;m just going to post the results of an initial exercise. Here I attempt to replicate model results from Cobb et al. (2012). The model in that paper simulates the spread of disease and resulting tree mortality and stand dynamics in a mixed system of tanoak, bay laurel, and redwood.</description>

      <description>[Jordi Bascompte](http://bascompte.net/) gave a [Storer
Lecture](http://bioscinet.ucdavis.edu/Events/Events/Storer) at UC Davis
on November 15, 2012. Here are my rough notes:

-   Biodiversity as the set of interactions *between* species, rather
    than accounting of species
-   Most research in mutualism in evolution focus on bilateral
    interactions (e.g., Darwin&#39;s orchids and moths)
-   Jordi&#39;s goal is to use network theory to represent mutualism in</description>

      <description>Lauren Yamane talked about Andersen et al. (2004) in our Ecological Stoichiometry course today. Here are her slides, and below, my rough notes on the paper:  Notes on the Paper ------------------ - Stoichiometry is a way of representing food quality - there is evidence that consumers have preference for high quality (e.g., low C:N) food. - There is often a mismatch between composition of prey (autotrophs) and needs of consumers.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow in my stoichiometry seminar I&#39;ll be talking about the dynamics
of growth under multiple nutrient limitation and acclimation. Here are
my notes:

Rastetter and Shaver (1992)
---------------------------

In this paper, Rastetter and Shaver introduce a model of plant growth on
multiple nutrients, with the goal of understanding the conditions under
which single- and multiple-nutrient limitation arise, the difference
between short- and long-term behavior, and the role of</description>
