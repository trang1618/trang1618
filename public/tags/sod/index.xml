      <description>Many ecological processes are best represented by individual-based
models (IBMs), where processes at the scale of individual scale of
organisms and their actions are modeled explicitly. Such processes can
pose a problem for management or control; our observational scale,
control levers, or management goals may be limited to coarser scales
than the individual.

IBMs suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The number of possible
states of the system, which consists of the possible states and</description>

      <description> For the past week I&#39;ve been at the [Mathematical Biosciences Institute](http://mbi.osu.edu/) at Ohio State, attending the [Workshop on Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources](http://mbi.osu.edu/2013/ws3description.html). It&#39;s been an absolutely top-notch meeting. I need to get myself to more of these small workshops. I brought a poster describing some of my work in progress on managing Sudden Oak Death. Here it is, and it&#39;s archived over at [Figshare](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.833911).  </description>

      <title>Some analytics: Does age structure matter for disease spread?</title>

      <description>My [first crack at an age-structured disease model with multiple infections](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/6/11/multi-infection-tests.html) yielded the interesting result that one could observe differences in disease rates across age without any actual differences in the biology between old and young individuals. Today I&#39;m trying to answer a different question analytically: does age structure matter for the course of the disease in the whole population? Here&#39;s the model. There are two minor changes: I no longer scale $J$ and $A$ with $K$ in the third and fourth equations; there&#39;s no reason the encounter rate should be tied to carrying capacity.</description>

      <title>The null model for age effects with overdispersed infection</title>

      <description>How does overdispersion of infections affect the behavior of the [multiple-infection model](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/6/11/multi-infection-tests.html)? I redefine the model to account for overdispersion, assuming the same overdispersion occurs in both age classes. The parameter $k$ varies inversely with the degree of overdispersion. Again, the classes are demographically identical, and infection affects mortality but not growth: $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dJ}{dt} &amp;= A f_A \left(1 - \frac{J+A}{K} \right) + J \left(f_J \left(1 - \frac{J+A}{K} \right) - d_J - g\right) - \alpha P_J \\ \frac{dA}{dt} &amp;= J g - A d_A - \alpha P_A \\ \frac{dP_J}{dt} &amp;= \lambda \frac{J}{K} (P_J + P_A) - P_J \left(d_J + \mu + g + \alpha \left(1 + \frac{(k+1)P_J}{kJ} \right) \right) \\ \frac{dP_A}{dt} &amp;= \lambda \frac{J}{K} (P_J + P_A) + P_J g - PA \left(d_A + \mu + \alpha \left(1 + \frac{(k+1)P_A}{kA} \right) \right) \end{aligned}$$ I define the model and run it in R below, using values of $k$ ranging from 0.</description>

      <description>*Here&#39;s a little thought exercise I did that has caused me to go back and restart my Sudden Oak Death modeling in a new framework. Feedback welcome. I&#39;m especially interested in relevant literature -- I haven&#39;t found many good examples of macroparasite/multiple infection models with age structure.* Introduction ------------ Cobb et al. (2012) develop two models of forest stand demography in the face of Sudden Oak Death. The first, a statistical survival model, estimated the rates of infection and time-to-mortality as functions of density of infected trees and tree size.</description>

      <description>*A first draft, just out to my committee. Feedback welcome! A modifiable souce version can be found on github [here](https://github.com/noamross/openquals/blob/master/Dissertation%20Proposal.md)* Abstract -------- Forest disease spreads through plant communities structured by species composition, age distribution, and spatial arrangement. I propose to examine the consequences of the interaction of these components of population structure *Phytophthora ramorum* invasion of California redwood forests. First, I will compare the dynamic behavior of a series of epidemiological models that include different combinations of population structure.</description>

      <description>The amazing [UpGoer5 text editor](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/) only allows you to use the 1000 most commonly used words in the english language. Here is [my research described using only those words](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/?i=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):  Sometimes many trees get sick and die very quickly.

      <description>My study system is Sudden Oak Death (SOD) in California Forests, so my examiner [David Rizzo] has given me plenty of readings on the subject. There&#39;s too much for a pithy summary here, but some highlights about the disease&#39;s biology: - SOD is caused by *Phytophthora ramorum*, a water mold in the same family as brown algae. It&#39;s origin is unknown, but 3 lineages are known, two dominant in California and one in Europe.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s the first of my quals reading summaries, this landscape forest
pathology. [David Rizzo](http://ucanr.org/sites/rizzolab/) will be
examining me on this topic.

Summary
-------

Much of our knowledge of pathology is at the organismal level
(host-pathogen interactions), but actual management occurs at stand,
forest, and regional levels. To understand and manage forest diseases at
this scale, we need appropriate epidemiological and landscape ecology
tools and frameworks.</description>

      <description>This is a description of the model I&#39;ve implemented in the [SODDr
package](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2012/11/16/sod-dynamics-1.html),
which I prepared for a presentation for the Hastings lab meeting on
November 29, 2012.

Background
----------

[Sudden Oak Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_oak_death) (SOD)
is a disease that threatens tanoak populations in California. It&#39;s cause
is an introduced pathogen, *Phytophthora ramorum*. *Phytophthora* is a
water mold that spreads by wind-blown rain and fog as well as through</description>

      <description>I am working on a project with the [Rizzo Lab](http://ucanr.edu/sites/rizzolab/) examining the dynamics of Sudden Oak Death (SOD). I really have to write more about this, but today I&#39;m just going to post the results of an initial exercise. Here I attempt to replicate model results from Cobb et al. (2012). The model in that paper simulates the spread of disease and resulting tree mortality and stand dynamics in a mixed system of tanoak, bay laurel, and redwood.</description>
