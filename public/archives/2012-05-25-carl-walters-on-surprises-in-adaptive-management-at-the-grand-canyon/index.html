Central tenet of adaptive management is that policies should be treated
as experimental treatments with uncertain outcomes.

The practice originated with NASA's model simulations to troubleshoot
space missions. This inspired ecological managers. However, soon it was
realized that there were key ecological processes for which there wasn't
any data and it was unlikely that data would be forthcoming. The
recruitment process in fisheries is a good example. Also, ecological
theory wasn't predictive (or very good) at the time. The "natural flow
paradigm" in river management, for instance promoted the idea that one
should restore historic flows, but this is built on a misunderstanding
of evolutionary theory - organisms could respond positively or
negatively to a changed environment.

Three variations on adaptive management

-   **AM "lite":** Assuming knowledge is basically correct, monitor and
    correct as neccessary
-   **AM for optimists:** Assume knowledge of the right basic policy, do
    "probing" experiments to detect opportunity for improvement. This
    makes management and experimentation somewhat separate efforts
-   **AM with humility:** Assume nothing, treat every policy choice as
    an experiment.

    *You're going to do the experiment, the issue is whether you do it
    well.*

Adaptive management has a poor record in implementation. Implementation
failure is more common than modeling failure. (Modeling is where you
figure out what you don't know).

Grand Canyon Case Study
-----------------------

Starts at Glan Canyon Dam, which wasn't designed to release water from
the top. The water is released at the bottom, so it's very cold. Dam
removed seasonal variation, but created very strong diurnal variation
because of change in hydropower demand. (Hydro dams are faster to spin
up and down than coal or other plants.)

In the 1990s, they increased minimum flows at night, and reduced the
daytime peak. The exact pattern has changes with different experimental
treatments.

Much recent policy focus has been on maintaining native fish, which go
up tributaries to spawn and rear and return to main stem river to grow
as adults.

*Aside - average beer consumption during grand canyon field work is
10/scientist/day*

Ecological monitoring has revealed a strong gradient in production. Most
productive in clear waters near dam, not productive downstream in more
turbid water. Factor of 1000 in density of most organisms.

Scientists tend to design monitoring systems for large systems where
there is intense monitoring at a few sites. However, the better strategy
is to monitor extensively at many sites.

### Primary policy objectives

-   Produce power for Southwest region
-   Conserve the sandy beaches as camp sites for rafters
-   Conserve and restore native fishes (several locally extinct,
    objective driven by ESA. Humpback chub is important species)
-   Maintain healthy "blue ribbon" trout fishery
-   A few others - cultural resources, etc.

### Manipulations

-   Experimental floods - these have built sand bars (temporary), and
    triggered rainbow trout increase.
-   Beach habitat building flows
-   Modified low fluctuating flows
-   Low summer steady flows
-   Trout suppression flows - strong diurnal flows to drive down
    invasive species
-   Unintended warming treatment when Lake Powell water level dropped
-   Fall steady flows to support juvenile native fish
-   Mechanical removal (electrofishing) of trout

### Surprises in the system

We only learn when there are surprises.

Expectations are initially set via both conceptual (verbal and
graphical) models and numerical models. However, reasonable models
widely diverge in predictions. (e.g., effect of controlling water
temperature releases on dam).

-   Beaches created by experimental floods erode quickly
-   Teleconnections between different fish populations under reduced
    flow variation leads to increased trout. Trout disperse very far and
    predate on native fish, so treatments near dam affect native fish
    populations far away.
-   Steady flows resulted in a very fine-grained patchy pattern of
    near-shore warming. This triggered more experiments to create
    warm-water habitat for native fish.
-   Flooding creates microhabitat for invertebrates, which in turn
    causes such large spikes in trout population that growth is stunted.
    This was confirmed by looking back at historic records. Having both
    experimental and historical data provides much better evidence.
-   Native fish growth and survival have gone *down* under steady flows.

#### Challenges

-   Inadequacy in some areas of long-term monitoring. This challenges
    ability to fit data to simulation model.

#### Lessons

Modeling is there to tell you what you don't know and warn about gaps in
data and knowledge.

### State of affairs

-   New EIS will prescribe treatments for 20 years
-   Debate over whether to continue experimentation

Comments and questions
----------------------

-   What are the relative difficulties with a river versus something
    with spatial extent?
    -   It's *much* easier when there is spatial replication. Most
        advanced programs are in forests. Inspiration for much of this
        is agricultural experimental programs. The only trouble with
        spatial programs are that the responses can be long-term and the
        monitoring cost can be very high across many spatial replicates.
    -   Key issue is innovation in monitoring

-   What about treating the Grand Canyon along with other systems as a
    group monitoring project?
-   How to incite users to participate in experiments if they think it
    will result in answers against their interests?
    -   Need some central authority, unless you can create economic
        incentives.
        -   *Super interesting idea! - incentives for experimentation,
            not just mitigation*

-   Major challenge is different between time scales of when managers
    need knowledge and how long it take biology to respond
-   Personal connection to the canyon is central to success. Few areas
    have such a dedicated community, who love it enough to compromise
    when they need to
-   Adaptive management is constrained - the best or adequate choice
    might not be in the feasible set
    -   It's useful to be able at least to avoid some of the worst
        choices. Also, the modeling exercises often offer alternative
        choices not originally considered

-   What's the level of optimism that we'll ever know the system well
    enough
    -   AM isn't about understanding the complexity. It's about testing
        management options. Understanding nature is too high a bar for
        this. It's pretty much impossible.
    -   We DO need to do replicates though, because complexity generates
        so much extra variability. We also must watch for surprises in
        the system. As long as we focus on that we'll continue learning.

-   Does this mean that black-box AM is best? Or does mechanistic
    understanding speed up our ability to learn about policy?
    -   Mechanistic understanding is best probably for understanding
        what, when, and where to monitor.

-   On risk/uncertainty: Our society is excessively risk-averse, but
    scientists don't help if we hide the uncertainty. This is a big
    issue with credibility in climate science.
