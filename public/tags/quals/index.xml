      <description>*A first draft, just out to my committee. Feedback welcome! A modifiable souce version can be found on github [here](https://github.com/noamross/openquals/blob/master/Dissertation%20Proposal.md)* Abstract -------- Forest disease spreads through plant communities structured by species composition, age distribution, and spatial arrangement. I propose to examine the consequences of the interaction of these components of population structure *Phytophthora ramorum* invasion of California redwood forests. First, I will compare the dynamic behavior of a series of epidemiological models that include different combinations of population structure.</description>

      <description>My study system is Sudden Oak Death (SOD) in California Forests, so my examiner [David Rizzo] has given me plenty of readings on the subject. There&#39;s too much for a pithy summary here, but some highlights about the disease&#39;s biology: - SOD is caused by *Phytophthora ramorum*, a water mold in the same family as brown algae. It&#39;s origin is unknown, but 3 lineages are known, two dominant in California and one in Europe.</description>

      <title>Quals Reading: Modeling Philosophy</title>

      <description>My examiner on theoretical ecology, [Marissa
Baskett](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/), suggested that I
return to some basic literature on the *why* of mathematical modeling in
ecology. Here are notes on three papers:

Summary
-------

-   Modeling *purpose* must be clearly defined, as this determines
    whether to focus on generality, realisms, and/or precision
-   Complexity is as often obfuscating as illuminating</description>

      <title>Quals Reading: Four Reviews of Forest Epidemiology</title>

      <description>Here&#39;s the first of my quals reading summaries, this landscape forest
pathology. [David Rizzo](http://ucanr.org/sites/rizzolab/) will be
examining me on this topic.

Summary
-------

Much of our knowledge of pathology is at the organismal level
(host-pathogen interactions), but actual management occurs at stand,
forest, and regional levels. To understand and manage forest diseases at
this scale, we need appropriate epidemiological and landscape ecology
tools and frameworks.</description>

      <description>My qualifying exams are on March 5, 2013. 78 days away! I&#39;ll be trying
to blog my reading as well as the development of my proposal here and in
a [github repository](http://github.com/noamross/openquals). Today - my
topics and reading list.

-   [Forest Landscape Pathology](#forest-landscape-pathology)
    -   [Landscape-level disease
        management](#landscape-level-disease-management)
    -   [Sudden Oak Death](#sudden-oak-death)</description>
