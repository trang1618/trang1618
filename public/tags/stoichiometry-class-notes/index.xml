      <description>Our ecological stoichiometry course kicked off today. My initial training is in this area, which I called &#34;ecosystem biogeochemistry&#34;, but it was very much a geologically focused, big systems approach. It&#39;s interesting to approach this material from a more organism- and population-centric perspective that most Davis ecologists have. Today, [Alison](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alison_Marklein/) started us off with some first principles of nutrient constraints on ecology. Drawing a lot from Sterner and Elser (2002), but noting that a lot of these principles go all the way back to Lotka (1925).</description>
