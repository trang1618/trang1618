      <description>This is a description of the model I&#39;ve implemented in the [SODDr
package](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2012/11/16/sod-dynamics-1.html),
which I prepared for a presentation for the Hastings lab meeting on
November 29, 2012.

Background
----------

[Sudden Oak Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_oak_death) (SOD)
is a disease that threatens tanoak populations in California. It&#39;s cause
is an introduced pathogen, *Phytophthora ramorum*. *Phytophthora* is a
water mold that spreads by wind-blown rain and fog as well as through</description>

      <description>[Jordi Bascompte](http://bascompte.net/) gave a [Storer
Lecture](http://bioscinet.ucdavis.edu/Events/Events/Storer) at UC Davis
on November 15, 2012. Here are my rough notes:

-   Biodiversity as the set of interactions *between* species, rather
    than accounting of species
-   Most research in mutualism in evolution focus on bilateral
    interactions (e.g., Darwin&#39;s orchids and moths)
-   Jordi&#39;s goal is to use network theory to represent mutualism in</description>

      <description>Lauren Yamane talked about Andersen et al. (2004) in our Ecological Stoichiometry course today. Here are her slides, and below, my rough notes on the paper:  Notes on the Paper ------------------ - Stoichiometry is a way of representing food quality - there is evidence that consumers have preference for high quality (e.g., low C:N) food. - There is often a mismatch between composition of prey (autotrophs) and needs of consumers.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow in my stoichiometry seminar I&#39;ll be talking about the dynamics
of growth under multiple nutrient limitation and acclimation. Here are
my notes:

Rastetter and Shaver (1992)
---------------------------

In this paper, Rastetter and Shaver introduce a model of plant growth on
multiple nutrients, with the goal of understanding the conditions under
which single- and multiple-nutrient limitation arise, the difference
between short- and long-term behavior, and the role of</description>

      <description>Pretty raw notes this week from a discussion about how food webs respond to nutrient starvation and excess. ### Whalen on consumption in Food Webs  - Boersma and Elser (2006) - fitness cost of excessive P. Implications for models - but what about competition as a more likely limiting factor? - Not sure about the &#34;food left on the table&#34; argument. - What about the metabolic costs? Not mentioned in the paper.</description>

      <description>![Panelists at the floodplains workshop. Left to right: Ron Unger, Dave Shpak, Richard Howitt, Petrea Marchand, Elizabeth Andrews, Paul Brunner, and J. D. Wikert. See below for affiliations and titles](/assets/old-blog-stuff/igertpanel.jpg) We had a fantastic workshop on Floodplain Restoration on September 14 as part of our work with UC Davis’ REACH IGERT program. Here are my notes: * * * * * Geologist and prolific floodplain-er [**Jeff Mount**](https://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/faculty/mount.html) introduced the day with an overview of the scale of changes in the Central Valley and the types of challenges that had to be overcome to produce functioning floodplains.</description>
