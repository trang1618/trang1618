      <description>General Problem and Approach Shifts between &#34;states&#34; in ecological systems are shifts between dynamical regimes, or between different attractors within a dynamical regime.
The warning signals approach attempts to detect characteristics of a system undergoing a transition between dynamical regimes. This transition may have common properties in many systems [#Scheffer2009;], but not all systems [#Hastings2010;].
Another approach would be to characterize the properties of the dynamic regime over a period of time, and attempt to detect if those properties change, irrespective of whether the change takes the particular form.</description>

      <description>Pollen  Met with Alan to discuss the conceptual model for regime shift. His suggestion was to look at Sugihara&#39;s method of prediction by looking at the difference paths of different systems - useful for when we have lots of data, even if it&#39;s sparse for individual sites. Some papers to look at are :  http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/76859 - &#34;Distinguishing Error from Chaos in Ecological Time Series&#34; http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/54223 - &#34;Nonlinear Forecasting for the Classification of Natural Time Series&#34;</description>

      <description>Class: Theoretical Ecology  First class meeting with Alan - see notes Readings (See notes):  Hastings (2008) &#34;Editorial â€“ an ecological theory journal at last&#34; Kareiva (1989) &#34;Renewing the dialogue between theory and experiments in population ecology&#34; Scheiner and Willing (2008) A general theory of ecology   Process - Kintr  Installed and learned the knitr package. Looks like a great way to write literate code more easily  Easy enough to process Multimarkdown, but if processing MMD to Latex/PDF, want to put knitr between the LaTeX and PDF for better processing.</description>

      <description>Letter  Submitted public university funding letter to Frontiers in Ecology and Environement. Follow up in a week.January 9, 2012   Warning signals  Read Bel et. al. (2012) &#34;Gradual regime shifts in spatially extended ecosystems.&#34; and discussed with Carl. Interesting. Shows a simple model of transition between spotted spatial patterning and uniform landscapes, describes the &#34;snaking&#34; bifurcation pattern between the two. Might be applicable to pollen stuff below.  Pollen  Read Williams et.</description>

      <description>For the seminar I organized on forest pests this quarter, we generated a bibliography of all the papers read or referred to for the various topics. &amp;nbsp;It can be found here:

      <description>Pollen Data for Williams (2010) &amp;nbsp;
 List of sources of data, but not data, is in a table in the supplementary material Most records are from North American Pollen Database (NAPD)  Just browsing through the datasets from this, it looks like a challenge may be that there isn&#39;t much data preceding most of the abrupt shifts - there may not be anything resembling a baseline.

      <description>Met with Stephen Pacala last week, who suggested we look into records of pollen sediments in lakes (varves) as potential data sources for early warning signals. Some potential sources:
 A paper reviewing regime shifts in the pollen records:  Drying period in N. American midwest look promising Williams, J. W., J. L. Blois, and B. N. Shuman. 2011. Extrinsic and intrinsic forcing of abrupt ecological change: case studies from the late Quaternary.</description>
