      <description>In [my first pass at text analysis of the ESA program](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2014/7/24/esacorpuscompare.html), I looked at how the frequency of words used in the ESA program differed from last year to this year. There are much more sophisticated ways at looking at word use in text, though, and I began to dive into the text-mining literature to find other ways to draw insight from ESA abstracts. One method I found is *topic modeling* using [latent Dirichlet allocation](http://en.</description>

      <description>After my [last post](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2014/7/24/esacorpuscompare.html) text-mining [ESA Annual Meeting](http://esa.org/am/) abstracts, [Nash Turley](http://www.nashturley.org/) [was interested](https://twitter.com/NashTurley/status/495272858038595587) in the presence of the term &#34;natural history&#34; in ESA abstracts. I decided to collect a little more data by including programs back to 2010, giving a five-year data set. Thankfully the program back to 2010 remains in mostly the same format, so it&#39;s easy to pull the data for these additional years. Now, not all talks that include natural history concepts will include the term &#34;</description>

      <description>[ESA](http://esa.org/am/) is just around the corner, and many of us are
gearing up and trying to figure out a
[schedule](http://eco.confex.com/eco/2014/schedule/index.cgi) to cover
all the talks and people we can pack in. ESA is a big conference and
there&#39;s far too much for any one person to see. In the end, everyone
experiences a [different part of the
elephant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant).

review](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12080-013-0192-6) out on early warning signals and

around for a couple of years and finally got around to writing up for a
special issue of [*Theoretical
Ecology*](http://link.springer.com/journal/12080).

There has been a lot of excitement in the past six years or so about

      <description>The amazing [UpGoer5 text editor](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/) only allows you to use the 1000 most commonly used words in the english language. Here is [my research described using only those words](http://splasho.com/upgoer5/?i=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):  Sometimes many trees get sick and die very quickly.

      <description>My examiner on theoretical ecology, [Marissa
Baskett](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/), suggested that I
return to some basic literature on the *why* of mathematical modeling in
ecology. Here are notes on three papers:

Summary
-------

-   Modeling *purpose* must be clearly defined, as this determines
    whether to focus on generality, realisms, and/or precision
-   Complexity is as often obfuscating as illuminating</description>
