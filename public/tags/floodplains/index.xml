See below for affiliations and titles](/assets/old-blog-stuff/igertpanel.jpg) We had a fantastic workshop on Floodplain Restoration on September 14 as part of our work with UC Davis’ REACH IGERT program. Here are my notes: * * * * * Geologist and prolific floodplain-er [**Jeff Mount**](https://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/faculty/mount.html) introduced the day with an overview of the scale of changes in the Central Valley and the types of challenges that had to be overcome to produce functioning floodplains.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m pretty pleased that my IGERT team&#39;s work has garnered both Judge&#39;s Choice and Community Choice awards in the [IGERT video and poster competition](http://posterhall.org/igert2012/posters/306). IGERT [(Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship)](http://www.igert.org/) is a National Science Foundation program to foster interdisciplinary research at the graduate level. Here at UC Davis, [our team](http://reach.ucdavis.edu/people/trainees.html) includes ecologists and a historian, and we have been looking at how floodplain restoration can be shaped by both bioeconomic constraints and historical legacies.</description>
