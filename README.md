# Trang Le's personal webpage

This is the repository for my personal webpage, <https://trang.page>.
Apart from minor changes, I mostly followed [Noam Ross' open code](https://www.noamross.net/2019/08/09/a-new-website/) for this site:

-   The page is generated using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site
    generator, with the R package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)
    generating [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ss) posts.
-   The [Kube](https://imperavi.com/kube/) framework by Imperavi provides basic layout and user-interaction.
-   Design inspiration is taken from Greg Restall's
    [consequently.org](https://consequently.org/) and the lovely but defunct
    [Gentle Reader](https://web.archive.org/web/20160313103811/http://thegentlereader.net/).  
-   Some design elements are inspired by Edward Tufte's handout designs, as
    implemented in the [tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) framework.
-   The site uses the fonts [Alegreya](https://huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-ht-pro) by [Huerta Tipogr√°fica](https://huertatipografica.com/).
    and [IM Fell English](https://iginomarini.com/fell/), extracted from John Fell's historic types by [Igino Marini](https://iginomarini.com). Fonts are served by
    [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Icons are provided by
    [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com).
-   My [CV](/vitae/) is generated from data on [ORCiD](https://orcid.org) using the [*rorcid*](https://github.com/ropensci/rorcid) package.
-   The page is deployed using [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
