Abstract
--------

Forest disease spreads through plant communities structured by species
composition, age distribution, and spatial arrangement. I propose to
examine the consequences of the interaction of these components of
population structure *Phytophthora ramorum* invasion of California
redwood forests. First, I will compare the dynamic behavior of a series
of epidemiological models that include different combinations of
population structure. Then I will fit these models to time-series data
from a network of disease monitoring plots to determine what components
of forest population structure are most important for prediction of
disease spread. Using the most parsimoniuous models, I will determine
optimal schedules of treatment to minimize the probability of
precipitous decline of host populations.

Introduction: Modeling Disease in Complex Populations for Management
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Forest diseases can radically transform ecosystems. In North America,
chestnut blight, Dutch elm disease and beech bark disease have caused
precipitous declines in their hosts, leading to changes in the structure
and function of forests. Changes from such diseases may be the dominant
force changing the face of some forests in coming decades, overwhelming
other forms of rapid environmental change such as climate change (Lovett
et al. 2006).

Even simple host-disease systems exhibit complex dynamics (Kermack and
Mckendrick 1927). Forest disease dynamics include additional complexity
driven by pathogen life cycles, variation in pathogen and host
populations, spatial strucure, and demographic and environmental
stochasticity (Hansen and Goheen 2000, Holdenrieder et al. 2004). These
factors yield greater complexity in disease dynamics. This complexity,
combined with limited monitoring data and the uncertainty of the
parameters of emergent diseases, makes prediction of disease dynamics
difficult. Yet such prediction is needed to allocate limited resources
for treatment and prevention.

One source of complexity in forest disease dynamics is structured
variation in host populations. Host tree populations may consist of
multiple species or genotypes, and consist of multiple sizes, each of
which may interact with disease or each other differently (Gilbert and
Hubbell 1996). All forest tree populations are spatially structured;
non-motile individuals can not be "well-mixed" (Filipe and Maule 2003).
Each of these forms of population structure have consequences for
population dynamics that have been examined in theoretical models (Park
et al. 2001, 2002, Dobson 2004, Klepac and Caswell 2010). However,
dynamics resulting from these components of population structure
*interacting* are not well-characterized.

Understanding modeled dynamics of disease in structured populations may
provide insights useful for management. However, the ability to use such
models for management planning depends requires confidence in their
predictive power, particularly under novel management treatments. Recent
developments in *particle filter* techniques allow estimation of the
likelihoods of complex dynamic models (Arulampalam et al. 2002, Ionides
et al. 2006, Knape and de Valpine 2012), and subsequent comparison of
models in out-of-sample predictive performance (Vehtari and Ojanen
2012). Fitting dynamic models direclty provides more confidence in the
dynamic results than deriving madel parameters individually from data,
because allows tests confidence in models' emergent dynamics rather than
separate components.

Sudden oak death (SOD) is an emerging forest disease in California and
Oregon that threatens populations of tanoak (*Notholithocarpus
densiflorus*) (Rizzo and Garbelotto 2003), has the potential to modify
community structure (Metz et al. 2012), and cause significant economic
damage (Kovacs et al. 2011). Silvicultural, chemical, and other control
techniques can modify the progression of disease (Swiecki and Bernhardt
2013), but eradication of SOD is unlikely [@Cobb2013] even at local
scales. Long and short- and long-term solutions to limit the damage of
disease will require continuous treatment and monitoring regimes. Under
budget constraints, planning for such treatment can be informed by
dynamics models via optimal control techniques.

I aim to answer the following overall questions:

1.  How do interactions between community, size, and spatial structure
    affect disease dynamics in forests?
2.  What aspects of population structure are most important in
    determining the probability and size of forest disease outbreaks in
    theoretical models?
3.  What aspects of population structure are most important in
    *predicting* the probability and size of SOD outbreaks?
4.  What control strategy minimizes the probability of SOD outbreaks at
    least cost?

Background
----------

### Sudden Oak Death

Sudden Oak Death (SOD) is an emerging forest disease in California and
Oregon that poses risks to forests across North America and Europe.
First observed in California in the mid-1990s, SOD is caused by the
water mold *Phytophthora ramorum* (Rizzo et al. 2002). *P. ramorum*
often kills tanoak (*Notholithocarpus densiflorus*), which provide
habitat and food to many vertebrate species, and are the primary host of
ectomycorrhizal fungi in redwood forests (Rizzo and Garbelotto 2003).
Loss of this species may have cascading effects on other species. The
disease has also caused significant economic damage through removal
costs and property value reduction (Kovacs et al. 2011). It has the
potential to spread to species in other regions, such as northern red
oak (*Quercus rubra*), one of the most important eastern timber species
(Rizzo et al. 2002).

### Population Structure: Multiple Host Species

*Phytophthora ramorum* has over 100 host species in 40 genera, which
fall into several functional types (Swiecki and Bernhardt 2013). In
canker hosts, which are all members of *Fagaceae* in California,
pathogen produces cankers on the trunk. Few if any spores are produced
from the cankers, and these hosts are generally dead ends. SOD is fatal
to many canker costs. In foliar hosts, *P. ramorum* resides and
reproduces in leaves and twigs. Foliar hosts vary greatly in
susceptibility to disease and spore production from diseased
individuals. Some hosts are dead ends; others are major drivers of
disease spread and survival.

In Redwood forests in Northern California, the hosts of importance are
tanoak and bay laurel (*Umbellularia californica*). Tanoak has the
dubious distinction of being the only species that is both a canker and
foliar host, and the disease is generally lethal in these trees. Bay
laurel is a foliar host in which *P. ramorum* produces prolifically, and
bay suffers no harm from the disease (DiLeo et al. 2009). Redwood and
other species are unsusceptible or dead-end hosts where *P. ramorum* has
little detrimental effect. In forests of the redwood-tanoak-bay complex,
bay Laurel acts as the primary disease reservoir [@Davidso2008]. Tanoak
infection and mortality is dependent on bay density (Cobb et al. 2012),
and removal of bay is a commonly suggested treatment to reduce risk of
SOD outbreaks (@Filipe2013; Swiecki and Bernhardt 2013).

Dobson (2004) examined a model of disease in multiple host species based
on an the SIR (Kermack and Mckendrick 1927) framework. In it, species
had density dependence but interacted only though disease transmission.
Importantly, transmission between species was always equal or less than
transmission between species. Dobson found that in when transmission was
density-dependent, species had a complementary effect on the disease's
rate of reproduction $(R_0)$; that is, a mix of both species led to
faster outbreaks. However, in the frequency-dependent case, $R_0$ was
greatest when one species dominated. Transmission between species
dampens and synchronizes disease oscillations in each species, and at
very high contact rates between species the most susceptible species are
more like to go extinct. Craft and Hawthorne (2008) implemented a
stochastic version of this model in a system of mamallian carnivores,
finding that species with low intra-species contact rates acted as sinks
for disease, and their contact with more social species increased spread
disease within these low-contact species.

SOD dynamics differ from these systems in a few important ways. First,
the contact structure among species may not be symmetrical. Contact
rates among trees are driven by differences in species transmissivity
(amount of spore produced) and susceptibility (probability of infection
per spore) than social grouping. Where one species with high
transmissivity coexists with a species of high susceptibility, the
probability of transmission may be higher between species than within.
Also, the spatial structure of species, and the dispersal pattern of
spores, may result in a hybrid between density and frequency-dependent
disease transmissions.

### Population Structure: Size/Stage Classes

Within the tanoak population, epidemiological characteristics vary with
tree size. Trees of larger size classes are more likely to be infected
and die more quickly than smaller tree (Cobb et al. 2012), Possibly due
to the vulnerability of cracked bark and the amount of bark tissue
available for invasion (Swiecki and Bernhardt 2005). There is no
evidence currently for variation in spore production or other
physiological effects across tree sizes [@Davidson2008].

When disease dynamics occur much faster than demographic processes, we
can treat size classes similarly to different species, and examine the
progression of disease in a constant population structure. However, when
disease progression and growth occur at similar rates, these processes
can interact to produce complex dynamics (Klepac and Caswell 2010). This
is the case with SOD; infectious periods can last many years, during
which trees may continue to grow.

The effects of age-based population structure and contact rates have
been studied extensively in the context of human disease and vaccination
programs (Anderson and May 1985, Metcalf et al. 2012). Reducing in-class
transmission rates at young ages increases the average age of infection,
independent of the exact contact structure. When only the
susceptibility, and not transmissivity, of each age class varies. Klepac
and Caswell (2010) found that increases in within-class transmission
increases both the infected and recovered population of those classes,
and classes with high transissivity have higher equilibrium populations
relative to low-transmissivity classes.

### Population Structure: Space

*P. Ramorum* dispersal interacts with host population structure at many
scales. The pathogen spreads between trees via wind-blown rain and
splash, limiting most spores to spread within 15m of host plants
(Davidson et al. 2005). However, occaisional weather events, such as
fog, can transport spores up to 3 km (Rizzo et al. 2005). Over longer
distances, *P. ramorum* can be transported in streams or spread via
human-mediated vectors such as nursery plant trade [@Osterbauer2004].
Meentemeyer et al. (2011) found that the best fit kernel for a statewide
model of *P. ramorum* spread was the sum of two Cauchy kernels, one on
the scale of tens of meters and another on the scale of tens of
kilometers.

Despite the ability to spread long distance, strong meter-scale
gradients mean that individual trees in stands can not be considered
"well mixed" in terms of contact rates between trees. Rather, contact
patterns across space arise from the interaction of spatial clustering
of trees and the dispersal kernel of the disease. Neither frequency- nor
density-dependent transmission characterizes this arrangement.

The effect of such spatial structure on development of epidemics has
been studied with continuous populations in space [@Bolker1999],
metapopulation models (Park et al. (2001); Park et al. (2002)), models
of individuals on a lattice (Filipe and Maule 2003, 2004) and discrete
individuals in continuous space (Brown and Bolker (2004)). These
approaches have reached similar conclusions of the effect of spatial
structure in non-mobile populations. In all cases, the threshold of
disease growth for a global outbreak $(R_0)$ is greater than the
threshold for a local epidemic $(R_L)$. For instance, in metapopulations
on a lattice, $R_0 = R_L (1 + z\varepsilon)$, where $z$ is the average
number of connections between patches and $\varepsilon$ is the
inter-patch contact rates (Park et al. 2001). In models of discrete
individuals in space, $R_0 = \lambda(1 + \bar{\mathcal{C}} SI)$, where
$\lambda$ would be the pathogen growth rate in a well-mixed population,
and $\bar{\mathcal{C}}$ is the dispersal kernel-weighted spatial
correlation between susceptible and infected individuals.
$\bar{\mathcal{C}}$ evolves over time but reaches a minimum that
represents the threshold required for a global epidemic (Brown and
Bolker 2004). Also, both clustering and anti-clustering (oversdispersal)
reduce the rate of increase of disease, except when clustering occurs at
the scale of dispersal, in which case it can accellerate spread.
Fat-tailed dispersal kernels accellerate spread, as well.

Study Approach
--------------

I will examine the comparative effects of the above components of
population structure on SOD epidemics by (1) characterizing the dynamic
behavior of models that include each type of structure and their
combinations and (2) identifying the model structure that best predicts
data of disease spread over time in redwood-tanoak-bay forests. Using
the best-fit model, I determine optimal control plans for stand
protection efforts to minimize the risk of loss of host plants.

### Determining the Consequences of Population Structure via Comparative Dynamics

>
> **2. What aspects of population structure are most important in
> determining the probability and size of forest disease outbreaks in
> theoretical models?**

To characterize the effects of the population structure on disease
dynamics, I will compare four models. All are extensions of the
epidemiological model of Cobb et al. (2012).

**Model A** is the simplest of the four models, only representing
structure in the form of differences between species of trees. It is
described by this system of stochastic difference equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{S}_{t+1} &\sim \boldsymbol{S_t} + \overbrace{  \text{Pois}\left[\boldsymbol{b(S_t+I_t)}\left(1-\sum_{i=1}^n w_i (S_{it} + I_{it}) \right) + \boldsymbol{rm_I I_t}\right]}^{\text{new recruits}} - \overbrace{\text{Binom}_1\left((\underbrace{1 - e^{-\boldsymbol{\beta I_t} - \boldsymbol{\lambda_{ex}}}}_{\text{force of infection}})\boldsymbol{S_t} \right)}^{\text{infections}} -\overbrace{\text{Binom}_2(\boldsymbol{m_S S_t})}^{\text{mortality}} \\
\boldsymbol{I}_{t+1} &\sim \boldsymbol{I_t} + \text{Binom}_1\left((1 - e^{-\boldsymbol{\beta I_t} - \boldsymbol{\lambda_{ex}}})\boldsymbol{S_t} \right) - \text{Binom}_3(\boldsymbol{m_I} \boldsymbol{S_t}) 
\end{aligned}$$

Here $\boldsymbol{S}_t$ and $\boldsymbol{I}_t$ are vectors of the
populations of susceptible and infected individuals of each species, and
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is the matrix of contact rates. Other parameters
are listed below in Table 1.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      Parameter Vector Symbol      Description
  -------------------------------- ------------------------------------
       $\boldsymbol m_{S,I}$       Probability of death per year, for
                                   both susceptible and infectious
                                   trees

          $\boldsymbol b$          Fecundity per individual per year.

          $\boldsymbol r$          Probability of resprouting after
                                   death by disease.

          $\boldsymbol w$          Competitive coefficient (relative
                                   contribution to density-dependent
                                   recruitment)

     $\boldsymbol \lambda_{ex}$    Rate of contact of each species with
                                   pathogen spores from outside the
                                   site
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  : Model A Parameters

New susceptible trees enter the system via density-dependent seedling
recruitment and resprouting from recently killed trees. Susceptible
trees become infected at rates proportional to contact with infected
trees (density-dependent), and pathogen migrating into the system. Both
susceptible and infected trees die at constant, but different, rates.

The model is modified from Cobb et al. (2012) in several ways: (1)
inclusion of demographic stochasticity, (2) conversion from continuous
to discrete time, (3) the inclusion of $\lambda_{ex}$, the force of
infection from areas outside the system, and (4) the exclusion of
recovery of infected trees, which has not been observed in the field.
Finally, the only population structure in Model A is the difference in
species parameters. It excludes age structure and spatial structure,
assuming a well-mixed population and frequency-dependent transmission
(Following Diekmann et al. (1990))

**Model B** adds stage structure to Model A. In this case, the vectors
$\boldsymbol{S_t}$ and $\boldsymbol{I_t}$ represent the population
divided by species and size class as follows

$$\begin{aligned}
S'_t &\sim S_t - \text{Binom}_1\left((1 - e^{-\boldsymbol{\beta I_t} - \boldsymbol{\lambda_{ex}}})\boldsymbol{S_t} \right) \\
I'_t &\sim I_t + \text{Binom}_1\left((1 - e^{-\boldsymbol{\beta I_t} - \boldsymbol{\lambda_{ex}}})\boldsymbol{S_t} \right) \\
S_{t+1} &\sim \text{Multinom}(\boldsymbol{A_S(S'_t,I'_t)S'_t}) + \text{Pois}\left[\boldsymbol{b(S'_t+I'_t)}\left(1-\sum_{i=1}^n w_i (S'_{it} + I'_{it}) \right) + \boldsymbol{rm_I I'_t}\right] \\
I_{t+1} &\sim \text{Multinom}(\boldsymbol{A_I(S'_t,I'_t)I'_t})
\end{aligned}$$

Here $\boldsymbol{A}$ is the matrix of demographic rates specifying
transitions between classes and mortality. $\boldsymbol{A}$ is a
block-diagonal matrix of size transition matrices, with no transitions
between species classes.

Disease transitions are separated in time from demmographic transitions
(Klepac and Caswell 2010). In California, *P. Ramorum* reproduces and
spreads during the winter rainy season while most tree growth occurs in
the spring and fall.

**Models 3 and 4** modify Models 1 and 2 by adding spatial structure in
the form of a lattice metapopulation. $\boldsymbol{S_t}$ and
$\boldsymbol{I_t}$ become $\boldsymbol{S_{jt}}$ and
$\boldsymbol{I_{jt}}$, matrices of each species and class at each
location. Furthermore, the force of infection
$\left((1 - e^{-\boldsymbol{\beta I_t} - \boldsymbol{\lambda_{ex}}})\boldsymbol{S_t} \right)$
is replaced with an overall force of infection $\Lambda_{jt}$ at each
location

$$\Lambda_{jt} =  \boldsymbol\beta \sum_{x=1}^J \phi (\boldsymbol I_{xt}, j, \boldsymbol{\theta}) + \lambda_{ex}$$

Here $j$ is the location, $\phi$ is the dispersal kernel of *P. ramorum*
from all locations $x$ to $s$, and $\theta$ is a vector of parameters of
the dispersal kernel. $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ remains the contact matrix,
representing physiological and vertical dispersal components of spore
dispersal. I will test the models using normal, exponential, and
power-law disperal kernels.

Using these four models, I will determine:

-   How global epidemic growth rate $R_0$, probability of global
    epidemic, the epidemic size, and time to extinction of both hosts
    and pathogens vary between the models
-   How the presence of each form of population structure affect these
    values when global species densities and mean parameter values
    remain identical
-   Whether the effects of population structure are additive or if they
    interact in a more complex way.

The model will be parameterized with three species: tanoak, bay, and
redwood, (the latter representing all non-host species). Parameters and
initial conditions will be drawn from Cobb et al. (2012) and
@Filipe2013.

### Selecting the Model that Best Repesents Observed Behavior

> **3. What aspects of population structure are most important in
> *predicting* the probability and size of SOD outbreaks?**

To apply the understanding developed in exploring model structure to
management, I must determine which model best represents observed
dynamics of SOD in forests. I will fit the four models above to data of
SOD spread in redwood-tanoak-bay forests in California and compare their
ability to predict disease development

#### Data

Data to fit the models comes from a collaboration with the Rizzo lab's
disease monitoring plot network [@Ref; @Ref; 2012]. The data consist of
observations tree size, alive/dead status, and disease status for trees
greater than 1 cm diameter from the years 2002-2007. Trees were observed
in 14 sites along the California coast from X (36.16°N) to Y (38.35°N),
each of which contains an average of 8 500 m^2^, seperated by minimium
distances of 100m and arranged in a random linear sequence. All plots
are in forests dominated by redwood, tanoak, and bay laurel.

Size, health, and disease status of all trees were measured in 2002 and
2007, as well as for a random sample of 5 previously infected and 5
previously uninfected trees of each species per plot in the years
2003-2006.

Since the time scale of the are not suffiently long to data to determine
transition between size classes, the parameters of transition matrices
will be drawn from other data from other sites and included as strong
priors on these parameters.

#### The Observation Model

The process generating the data above may be considered **hidden Markov
process** (Gimenez et al. 2012), that is, processes where the state of
the system is dependent on its previous state, but where states are
partially or imperfectly observed. Imperfect observation in this case is
due to incomplete counting of trees and error in determination of tree
disease status. Tree disease is determined by subjective examination of
symptoms in the field, and then confirmed in the lab for those
individuals with sufficiently suggestive symptoms. There are both false
positives and false negatives:

$$\begin{aligned}
 p_{OI} &= p(\text{Observing that tree is diseased}|\text{tree is diseased}) \\
 p_{OS} &= p(\text{Observing that tree is healty}|\text{tree is healthy})
\end{aligned}$$

Then, for each sub-population (by species, size class, or location)
observed in each time period, then, the observed number of susceptible
and infected trees are:

$$\begin{aligned}
S_{obs} \sim \text{Binom}\left(p_{OS} S + (1-p_{OI}) I \right) \\
N_{obs} \sim \text{Binom}\left(p_{OI} I + (1-p_{OS}) S \right) 
\end{aligned}$$

REALIZED WAS WRONG***

* * * * *

Finally, for models with size-class structure, the observations omit the
smallest size class (seeds and seedlings \< 1 cm), as these were not
measured.

#### Model Fitting

**Particle filtering** determines the likelihood of a hidden Markov
process by taking advantage of the fact that, at each time step, the
likelihood of a system state is dependent on the previous state
$(X_{t+1})$, and the observation $(Y_t)$.

$$p(X_t) = p(X_t | X_{t-1}, Y_t)$$

While $X_{1:t}$ is hidden, $p(X_t|X_{t-1})$ may be approximated by by
simulation of the model process. Repeated simulations (*particles*)
provide a distribution of outcomes from which average likelihood are
determined from the observation model $(p(X_t|Y_t))$. For each time
step, the particles are re-sampled according to their individual
likelihoods, in order to prevent *particle degeneracy* - most particles
approaching zero likelihood. The product of all steps' averaged particle
likelihoods is an unbiased estimate of the model likeihood.(Arulampalam
et al. 2002)

With an estimate of likelihood available, one needs an approach to
determine the maximum-likelihood estimate of the model parameters
$(\theta)$. Several methods are available. **Iterated filtering** (IF)
estimates $\theta$ by replacing constant parameter values with a random
walk $\theta_t$ of decreasing variance over time, and determining the
"states" of this walk as the variance approaches zero. IF is
computationally efficient but requires long time series.

Alternatively, **Particle Filter Markov Chain Monte Carlo** (PFMCMC)
uses a Markov Chain sampler (e.g., Metropolis-Hastings), calculating the
likelihood at each iteration using a particle filter. While
computationally expensive, it does not require long time series and may
be used with multiple time series. PFMCMC also integrates particle
filtering into a Bayesian context, allowing the use of informative
priors. I will used PFMCMC to determine maximum-likelihood
parameterizations for all four models.

When fitting models 1 and 2 to the data, populations from each plot in
each site will be aggregated. For models 3 and 4, each plot will
represent a single sub-population on a lattice spanning the site.
Initial density, species, age and disease distributions for other
sub-populations will be randomly generated from other points on the
lattice using the proportions from the measured plots. Epidemiological
parameters will remain constant across sites except for the external
force of disease $\lambda_{ex}$, which will be represented as a noramlly
distributed random variable to account for site effects. varies.

#### Model selection

Model selection criteria have multiple purposes: to determine which
model best represents "true" processes, and to estimate the utility of
models for the purposes of prediction. In this case, I am interested in
both - determining which components population structure matter, and
also providing an estimate of predictive stength of the best model. For
these purposes, I will use the **deviance information criterion**
(Spiegelhalter et al. 2002, DIC). DIC has several advantages. Since it
estimates the model complexity, or effective number of parameters,
directly from the likelohood distribution, it makes it easy to
incorporate random parameters such as $\lambda_{ex}$ that have
non-integer contributions to model complexity. Secondly, it estimates
the how priors on parameter values effect their contribution to model
complexity.

DIC is not suitable for model-averaging. However, model-averaged results
will not likely be useful for the optimization analysis below. Using the
best-DIC model for prediction is a compromise between predictive ability
and tractable analysis of the model used for prediction. Use of DIC
assumes that there is a "best" or "real" model within the comparison.
While no models are "true" (Box 1976), this excercise is selecting a
"best" or "most useful" model for scenario exploration.

### Using Dynamic Optimization to Determine the Best Control Strategy

> **4. What control strategy minimizes the probability of SOD outbreaks
> at least cost?**

The best-fit model that captures essential aspects of the disease
dynamics will be used to develop an optimal control solution to
minimization of disease risk over time.

While forest disease management can occur under multiple, conflicting
and uncertain goals and priorities, here I consider the case where
conservation of tanoak and its ecosystem services are the goal. This is
approximately the case in Humboldt County, California, where large
landowners have agreed to work in tandem to control the disease. In this
situation, managers goals can be simplified to three components: (1) The
minimum acceptable density of the species of interest $(N_{min})$, (2)
the cumulative acceptable probability that the species will fall below
that density $(p_{acc})$ during the management period, and (3) the cost
of disease control $C$. Using acceptable probabilities avoids the
challenge of defining and valuing the flows of ecosystem services as a
function of the forest composition (Hartman 1976).

Tools for SOD control can be categorized into two types. Silvicultural
(“host-centric”) treatments change forest composition.
“Pathogen-centric” treatments, such as quarantine, equipment cleaning
and spraying, reduce the probability of spore arrival (Swiecki and
Bernhardt 2013).

I represent these two types of treatment with two control functions.
Cutting is a periodic control treatment that can be imposed in any year.
I define the cut as a reduction in species density to the levels that
would minimize the probability of species densities falling below the
acceptable level over a management period without further controls. This
will be a value that balances stochastic risk of extinction with risk of
diseae outbreak, bounded by the minimum acceptable species density. As
tanoak and bay laurel trees have little timber value, each cut has a
cost $(c_1)$. For the purpose of this model $c_1$ is independent of the
extent of density reduction (that is, the variable costs of cutting are
negligible. Thus, the annual cost of cutting is $c_1 E_1$, where $E_1$
is a zero-one control variable

Spraying is an ongoing control treatment that represents the combined
annual effort to reduce the arrival of new spores at the site. This
modifies the external force of infection

$\lambda_{ex} \equiv \lambda_0 \times (1 - e^{-a E_2 c_2})$

where $a$ is the effectiveness of treatment, $E_2$ is the effort spent
at spraying and $c_2$ is the annual cost per unit effort.

The dynamic optimization problem is to determine the combination of
treatment effort over time $(E_1t, E_2t)$ that minimizes the cost of
treatment while maintaining the probability of species loss at an
acceptable level. That is,

$$\min \sum_{t=1}^T c_1(E_1)+ c_2(E_2) \text{ s.t. } p(N_t < N_{\min}) < p_{acc}$$

An alternative formulation, also useful to managers, is to minimize the
probability of outbreak given budget constraints $(B)$. Budget
constraints could be forumulated as total budgets for the entire
mangement period, or annual limits on spending. That is

$$\min \sum_{t=1}^T p_{(N_t < N_{\min})} \text{ s.t. } \sum_0^T c_1 (E_2) +  c_2(E_2) \leq B_T$$

or

$$\min \sum_{t=1}^T p_{(N_t < N_{\min})} \text{ s.t. } c_1(E_1) + c_2(E_2) \leq B_{ann} \forall \, T$$
