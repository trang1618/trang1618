-   **Work sessions**: We have weekly, 2-hour co-work sessions where users come
    to work on their own projects and get help.

-   **Talks and tutorials**: About every other week, the first half of our work
    sessions is dedicated to a presentation. These are mainly tutorials on tools
    in R. Sometimes they are "show-and-tell" where a user presents an analysis
    for feedback. Most speakers walk through a script on a large screen, and Q &
    A takes up half of the time.

-   **A Q & A listserv**: We use Google Groups to manage a listserv where people
    can ask questions, which is especially helpful for our many users who can't
    attend the weekly sessions.

    Global fora, like the [R mailing lists] or [Stack Overflow], are great,
    but in order to scale they need pretty strict rules that are challenging for
    beginners. Many beginners don't yet know how to frame questions to get good
    answers. Since our listserv is small-scale, new users can ask open-ended
    questions and expect responses more helpful than "RTFM."

-   **A website and blog**: Our blog mostly serves as a way to post [materials
    from our talks], usually `Rmd` scripts or slides. More recently we have
    been broadcasting our tutorials with Google Hangouts on Air and posting
    those videos, as well.

Some lessons learned
--------------------

After 2 years, D-RUG has proved a successful. A typical meeting brings 5-15
members, usually evenly split between regulars and those who come just when they
have questions. Attendance tends to be higher towards the beginning of the term
and when we have speakers. A fair number of on-campus (and LOTS of off-campus
users) view the tutorials online.400 members have signed up for the listserv.
10-20% of these are active posters, and most questions get answered in a day or
so.Most importantly, I've seen many users arrive with little or no experience,
and go on be our most useful helpers and give some of our best tutorials.

Here a few of the lessons I've learned in running D-RUG:

-   One major challenge is keeping enough advanced users engaged so that they
    can be a resource for beginners. Advanced users who attend work sessions can
    expect to spend about 50% of their time answering questions of others.

    The listserv is a low-commitment way for advanced users to help, and is even
    our advanced users ask questions on it sometimes. Our [sponsors at
    Revolution Analytics] send us a box of schwag each year - I use these as
    prizes to recognize helpful volunteers.

    Users who started off as beginners but have learned a lot through D-RUG tend
    to be our most dedicated volunteers.

-   There's a trade-off between running D-RUG as a meeting where people
    regularly give talks, and a space where people come to work.  I found a
    pretty good medium having weekly 2-hr work sessions, with talks every other
    week for half the session during the school year. More people tend to come
    to those sessions with talks.

-   It is constant work wrangling people to give talks, and one doesn't want to
    burden advanced users already volunteering their time with too many requests
    to give tutorials.  It's good to encourage people who are learning a new
    topic to give talks on things they just learned.  Also, encourage them to
    just walk through a script rather than make slides.  It's less work for the
    presenter, and the script is more useful to others afterwards than slides.

-   Users are much more likely to be interested in *applications* rather than
    programming topics. Talks on topics like "How to do AIC model comparison"
    and "How to prepare plots for publication" have been much more well attended
    (and heavily trafficked on the blog) than ones on topics like "speeding up
    code." This is partially a function of our membership (mostly empirical
    ecologists, biologists, and social scientists).

-   It takes time to build self-sustaining community. For our first year, I had
    to monitor the listserv to make sure questions didn't go unanswered, and I
    ran every work session and bugged power users to attend. Now the listserv
    runs itself and we have enough regulars at our work sessions. We would like
    to find some arrangements to help institutionalize the group more, though.
    One possibility is having professors or TAs for courses using R to hold
    office hours at D-RUG.

-   Food helps. We have snacks paid for by our [sponsor][sponsors at Revolution
    Analytics]. A lot of expert users and professors stop in for a mid-afternoon
    sugar infusion, and end up answering questions.

Users' Groups as a complementary tool for SWC
---------------------------------------------

Users' groups have the potential to be a complementary tool to SWC workshops. We
recruited a number of new members at the [June SWC Workshop at Davis], and
they've been able to practice and build those skills at our work sessions.
Users' groups also may be a good forum to stay connected to and follow up with
learners.

Beginners need a minimum amount of knowledge to take advantage of D-RUG, which
can be provided by SWC workshops. D-RUG doesn't have the resources or structure
to teach those beginners from scratch. I sometimes point new users who show up
with no experience to an appropriate online self-taught course, and encourage
them do the work at our sessions where they can get support. If these members
attend a SWC workshop, they will know enough to get started, and to support each
other.

The D-RUG model is fairly easy to replicate. Daniel Hocking at the University of
New Hampshire has [created a similar group]. Anyone with the skill level of
a typical SWC workshop helper can probably run a users' group, though it does require a certain amount of time and skill at recruiting on-campus.

I'd like to hear from others who have similar or alternative models.  How can these groups connect with SWC to build an ongoing community of learners?
