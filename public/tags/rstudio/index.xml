      <description>This a brief guide to using R in collaborative, social ways. R is a powerful open-source programming language for data analysis, statistics, and visualization, but much of its power derives from a large, engaged *community* of users. This is an introduction to tools for engaging the community to improve your R code and collaborate with others. *(Am I missing anything? Let me know in the [comments](#disqus_thread) and I&#39;ll update this guide.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been hunting for a lightweight CSV editor for OSX so I could to make fixes to data files and not need to fire up Excel. While you can edit a CSV file in any text editor, it&#39;s a pain to navigate the files without a spreadsheet-like interface. Unfortunately [there doesn&#39;t seem to be a good, free option out there](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/66214/are-there-any-free-and-lightweight-spreadsheet-programs-for-the-mac). Today I remembered R has a native XCode editor for editing data frames, and I realized I could write a function that would load the CSV as a data frame, let me edit it, then close and save it in CSV format again.</description>
