    Every good chart started out as a bad one. 
    In this workshop, we discuss 1) basic visualization principles, and 2) resources, tools, tips, and tricks that help improve our charts and refine our data stories. 
    Some familiarity with R and ggplot will be useful but not required - novice R users are encouraged to attend.
