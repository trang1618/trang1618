      <description>Lauren Yamane talked about Andersen et al. (2004) in our Ecological Stoichiometry course today. Here are her slides, and below, my rough notes on the paper:  Notes on the Paper ------------------ - Stoichiometry is a way of representing food quality - there is evidence that consumers have preference for high quality (e.g., low C:N) food. - There is often a mismatch between composition of prey (autotrophs) and needs of consumers.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow in my stoichiometry seminar I&#39;ll be talking about the dynamics
of growth under multiple nutrient limitation and acclimation. Here are
my notes:

Rastetter and Shaver (1992)
---------------------------

In this paper, Rastetter and Shaver introduce a model of plant growth on
multiple nutrients, with the goal of understanding the conditions under
which single- and multiple-nutrient limitation arise, the difference
between short- and long-term behavior, and the role of</description>

      <description>Pretty raw notes this week from a discussion about how food webs respond to nutrient starvation and excess. ### Whalen on consumption in Food Webs  - Boersma and Elser (2006) - fitness cost of excessive P. Implications for models - but what about competition as a more likely limiting factor? - Not sure about the &#34;food left on the table&#34; argument. - What about the metabolic costs? Not mentioned in the paper.</description>

      <description>Thresholds / Critical Depensation in Population Dynamics -------------------------------------------------------- Mechanisms for critical depensation (Allee effect): - Mate-finding (example: Right Whales) - Demographic stochasticity (can be captured by a deterministic threshold if stochasticity is not explicit) $$\dot{X} = -r\left(1- \frac{X}{\tilde{K}}\right)\left(1- \frac{X}{K}\right)X$$ Here, $\tilde{K}$ is the threshold of zero growth. Optimal Control --------------- ### Terminology - 1-dimensional: 1 control, 1 state variable State equation: $$\dot{X} = f(X,t,u(t))\, 0 \leq t \leq T$$ $X(t)$ is the *state variable*, u(t) is the *control variable*.</description>

      <description>Papers discussed: Gordon (1954), @Hardin1966, Scott (1955), Smith (1968) Gordon was a labor economist who was interested in why Eastern Canada was poor despite the abundant ocean resources. At the time, work by Beverton and Holt and others was producing very sophisticated *biological* fishery models. Gordons model of fish growth was: $$\dot{X}_t = a-bX_t - H_t$$ which was a linear rather than quadratic model with harvesting. The harvest rate was proportional to effort/capital $K_t$ and the biomass and catchability $q$ $$H_t = qK_tX_t$$ In steady state: $$X_{ss}[qK_s b] = a,\, X_{ss} = \frac{a}{b qK_{ss}} $$ With prices ($p$) and cost per unit effort ($w$) fixed, $$TR_{ss} = pqX_{ss}K_{ss} = \frac{apqK_{ss}}{b qK_{ss}}$$ $$TC_{ss} = wK_{ss}$$ !</description>

      <description>Reading ------- - Reviewing Gordon (1954) and Smith (1968) - Reading Wilen (1976) and @Clark1990 Notes on @Clark1990, Chapters 1-2 --------------------------------- General form of population dynamics is $\dot{x} = F(x) - h(t)$, that is, population growth minus harvest. This is similar in form to capital growth and consumption - Logistic growth - Constant harvest and MSY ### Fishing effort Catch-per-unit-effort assumption is that that the population (stock) level is proportional to the catch per unit effort, or $h = qEx$, where $E$ is effort and $q$ the catchability coefficient.</description>
