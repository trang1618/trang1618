      <description>*Here are my notes from a recent talk I gave on vectorization at a [Davis R Users&#39; Group](http://www.noamross.net/davis-r-users-group.html) meeting. Thanks to [Vince Buffalo](https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo), [John Myles White](http://twitter.com/johnmyleswhite), and [Hadley Wickham](http://twitter.com/hadleywickham) for their input as I was preparing this. Feedback welcome!* Beginning R users are often told to &#34;vectorize&#34; their code. Here, I try to explain *why* vectorization can be advantageous in R by showing how R works under the hood. Now, remember, [premature optimization is the root of all evil (Knuth)](http://c2.</description>

      <description>This a brief guide to using R in collaborative, social ways. R is a powerful open-source programming language for data analysis, statistics, and visualization, but much of its power derives from a large, engaged *community* of users. This is an introduction to tools for engaging the community to improve your R code and collaborate with others. *(Am I missing anything? Let me know in the [comments](#disqus_thread) and I&#39;ll update this guide.</description>

      <description>Today at [Davis R Users&#39; Group](http://www.noamross.net/davis-r-users-group.html), Rosemary Hartman took us through her work in progress fitting general additive models to organism presence/absence data. Below is her presentation and script. You can get the original script and data [here](https://gist.github.com/4048075) Also, check the comments below for some discussion of other options for this type of analysis, such as boosted regression trees.  ~~~~ {.r} ## GAMs using mgcv and amphibian presence/absence dataset ## code and data by Rosemary Hartman (rosehartman at gmail dot com) ## First, load the mgcv package (Simon Wood) library(mgcv) ## Now, attach your data set (or my data set) fishlakes |z|) ## (Intercept) 3.</description>

      <description>At DRUG today, [Chris Hamm](https://www.msu.edu/~chamm/Welcome.html) ([email](mailto:cahamm@ucdavis.edu)) showed us an easier way to combine multiple figures into one plot using `plot.new`, rather than `par(mfrow=...)` Here&#39;s his script:   .knitr.inline { background-color: #f7f7f7; border:solid 1px #B0B0B0; } .error { font-weight: bold; color: #FF0000; }, .warning { font-weight: bold; } .message { font-style: italic; } .source, .output, .warning, .error, .message { padding: 0em 1em; border:solid 1px #F7F7F7; } .source { background-color: #f7f7f7; } .</description>

      <description> In D-RUG today, [Stella Copeland](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Harrison/people/stella/copeland.html) gave a quick introduction to mixed models in R. Here&#39;s the script that she presented:  Get the data file for this script [here](https://gist.github.com/3919839#file_mixed_model_ex_data) Stella also recommends [this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2008.10.008) by [Ben Bolker](http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/) as a quick introduction to the topic. </description>

      <description>*I gave a short talk today to the [Davis R Users&#39; Group] about ggplot. This what I presented. Additional resources [at the bottom of this post](#some-resources)* `ggplot` is an R package for data exploration and producing plots. It produces fantastic-looking graphics and allows one to slice and dice one&#39;s data in many different ways. ### Comparing with base graphics *(This example from [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11679019/recreating-a-ggplot2-geom-point-using-base-graphics))* First, get the package: ~~~~ {.</description>

      <description>*Editor&#39;s Note: This is a repost of [Michael&#39;s original post](http://www.michaellevy.name/blog/dplyr-data-manipulation-in-r-made-easy) at his own site.* Here is the dplyr talk that I recently gave to the Davis R Users&#39; Group. dplyr is an R library that does basic data manipulation extremely well. It is designed to make the data handling tasks that we all do over and over as easy as possible. It produces highly readable syntax that is low cognitive overhead to write.</description>
