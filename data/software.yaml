  description: Penn Machine Learning Benchmarks (PMLB)
  long_description: >
    a repository contains the code and data for a large, 
    curated set of benchmark datasets for evaluating and 
    comparing supervised machine learning algorithms.
    These data sets cover a broad range of applications including 
    binary/multi-class classification problems and regression problems.

  description: Select features with nearest-neighbor concepts
  long_description: >
    a nearest-neighbor feature selection algorithm that fits a generalized linear model for projected distances of a given attribute over all pairs of instances in a neighborhood. 
    In the NPDR model, the predictor is the attribute distance between neighbors projected onto the attribute dimension, and the outcome is the projected phenotype distance (for quantitative traits) or hit/miss (for case/control) between all pairs of nearest neighbor instances.
