This a brief guide to using R in collaborative, social ways. R is a
powerful open-source programming language for data analysis, statistics,
and visualization, but much of its power derives from a large, engaged
*community* of users. This is an introduction to tools for engaging the
community to improve your R code and collaborate with others.

[Asking questions via e-mail, listservs and bulletin boards](#TOC)
------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the best ways to tap into the knowledge of the R community is to
use the listservs and websites devoted to answering questions about R.
There are a large number of these online forums. Some of the most
popular are the [R-help](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help)
listserv, the progamming Q&A site [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), and the
statistics Q&A site [Cross-Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/).
(Be sure to look at the [R] tags on these two sites.) There are also
[specialty listservs](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html) like
[R-sig-ecology](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-ecology), or
[local forums](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/local-r-groups.html)
like the [Davis R Users'
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/davis-rug).

These forums are great places to get help with your R questions. To get
good answers, though its important to know how to ask good questions.
Key to a good question is a **minimal reproducible example** (MRE). An
MRE is a bit of code that, when copy-and-pasted from an e-mail into R,
will reproduce the results or problem you are asking about. Here is a
[great guide to producing a reproducible
example](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5963610/1757441). A few important
components:

> -   a minimal dataset, necessary to reproduce the error
> -   the minimal runnable code necessary to reproduce the error, which
>     can be run on the given dataset.
> -   the necessary information on the used packages, R version and
>     system it is run on.
> -   in case of random processes, a seed (set by set.seed()) for
>     reproducibility

One useful trick for producing an MRE is the `dput()` command. `dput`
takes any object in R and prints it in a form that can be
copy-and-pasted. For instance, say you have a data frame like this:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .r}
df <- data.frame(a = 1:5, b = 6:10)
df
~~~~

    ##   a  b
    ## 1 1  6
    ## 2 2  7
    ## 3 3  8
    ## 4 4  9
    ## 5 5 10

Running `dput` creates text that can be entered into R make an identical
structure

~~~~ {.sourceCode .r}
dput(df)
~~~~

    ## structure(list(a = 1:5, b = 6:10), .Names = c("a", "b"), row.names = c(NA, 
    ## -5L), class = "data.frame")

Now you can insert this data into your MRE by typing:

    df <- structure(list(a = 1:5, b = 6:10), .Names = c("a", "b"), 
      row.names = c(NA, -5L), class = "data.frame")

Your real data is probably considerably larger and more complex, and
could be in the form of a data frame, list, or any other number of
objects. Try running `dput(mtcars)` to see the results with a larger
data set. It's often shorter to use `dput` on cleaned-up, manipulated
data than including a lot of data-manipulation steps in your MRE. If
your dataset is large, simply use `dput(head(mtcars))` to share only the
first few rows. [Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12647159/turning-a-data-frame-into-a-single-row) is an
example of how using this method yields useful responses.

Similarly, it is easy to share more information about your set up using
the `sessionInfo()` function. It returns information about your R
version, your platform, base, and loaded packages, all of which are
really helpful for troubleshooting purposes. Simply copy and paste the
output from the function alongside your question.

[Sharing R scripts with `gist.github.com`](#TOC)
------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you want to share an R code that you've written. Creating a
**gist** is a great way to do so. Gists are have several advantages over
sharing over e-mail:

-   You can share the code just by sending a URL
-   Syntax highlighting makes the code easier to read
-   You can update the code and it will remember previous versions
-   The gist can be public or private
-   People can comment on the gist and have a conversation

To post your code as a gist, go to <http://gist.github.com>, and paste
your code, and put in a brief description. You'll get an easily sharable
web page like this:

![](/assets/old-blog-stuff/gistexample.png)

Signing up for the website is not neccessary, but it is needed if you
want to revise your gist in the future.

A gist can include multiple files, so sometimes its useful for to
include both an R script and your source data file in one gist.

[Sharing reports of code and results with `knitr`](#TOC)
--------------------------------------------------------

Often you want to share the results of analyses you perform in R with
colleagues or the broader online community. A good way to do this is
with a *report* - a document of text, code, and results (often graphs).
`knitr` is an R package for making reports that can be printed or shared
on the web.

`knitr` takes documents that are a mixture of text and code, extracts
the code and runs it, and then inserts the code and results back in.
This has several advantages:

-   If you change your code, all you have to do is re-run knitr, rather
    than run the code, copy-and-paste results, and then do re-formatting
-   Colleagues who read your report can see exactly the steps you took
    to reach your results, and reproduce them if they want.

`knitr` can work with a variety of different document types: HTML,
LaTeX, etc., but most commonly people use **markdown**, which is a
simple syntax designed for producing web pages. Here's what a short
markdown document using `knitr` looks like:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .markdown}
Title
=====

This is an example document.  Here's a summary of some data:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Here is a plot of that data:

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
~~~~

If you save this file as `example.Rmd` (R-markdown), and run

    library(knitr)
    library(markdown)
    knit("example.Rmd")
    markdownToHTML("example.md")

You get an HTML file called `example.HTML`. Open it in a browser and it
looks like this:

![](/assets/old-blog-stuff/knitexample.png)

As you can see, your document has both your writing, code, and results,
formatted in an easy-to-read way. You can e-mail these documents or post
them online for easy sharing.

[Collaborating and version control](#TOC)
-----------------------------------------

If you are working with a team on a project that involves multiple R
analyses and data sets, you'll want a more robust system for
collaboration that just e-mailing files around. Here are two options.

### [Dropbox](#TOC)

An easy way to share your R files and maintain version control is to use
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/). Dropbox is a service that syncs
files across computers. If you and your collaborators share a Dropbox
folder, changes will automatically stay up-to-date across all your
computers. Importantly, Dropbox keeps previous versions of files and
lets you revert to past versions, so you can go back if something in
your code breaks:

![](/assets/old-blog-stuff/dropboxexample.png)

### [Git and Github](#TOC)

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a version-control system widely used by
programmers. It's much more powerful than Dropbox version control, with
features that include

-   Fine-scale control of what files and folders change with each update
-   Log messages to remind you of what changes were important with each
    version
-   Creating parallel versions (branches) of projects
-   Comparing different versions of files and folders
-   Merging changes made on different branches or by different users.

Git has a bit of a learning curve, but if you do a lot of programming
work in R or other languages, it is well worth it. To get started, see
the documentation [here](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki)

Using Git alongside a web service like [Github](https://github.com/) or
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) lets you collaborate on projects in
a very powerful way. Collaborators can work on code simultaneously,
merge changes and resolve conflicts through the website. If you choose
to make the project **open-source**, your code can be public and you can
tap into the expertise of many other collaborators.

The R package `devtools` lets you download and run files directly from
these websites.

[Package creation and sharing](#TOC)
------------------------------------

One of the great strengths of R is the collection of over 4,000 user
created packages. You might want to create a package if you have
developed a new method in R, or if you have a collection of helpful
functions that would be useful to share. If you write a scientific
publication using R for analysis, an accompanying package is a good way
to make the data and methods accessible for other researchers to
reproduce and build upon.

Hadley Wickham has written a great guide to developing R packages, which
can be found [here](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki). It
accompanies his package `devtools` which provides many useful tools for
package development.

[RStudio](#TOC)
---------------

If you want use the tools described above, it is helpful to use software
that integrates them into your workflow.
[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) is a popular *integrated development
environment* (IDE). An IDE makes working in R easier by putting the R
console, a text editor, file browser, help files, graphics and many
other tools together into a cohesive interface. RStudio also integrates
many of the collaborative tools described above. It is available for
Mac, Windows, and Linux.

![](/assets/old-blog-stuff/rstudio-windows.png)

If you use Rstudio, `knitr` is automated for you. Just hit the "Knit
HTML" button once you have written your R-markdown document, and it will
generate the web page and show a preview:

![](/assets/old-blog-stuff/knitbutton.png)

An additional benefit of using `knitr` from Rstudio is that it will give
you the option of automatically uploading the HTML document to their
server at <http://rpubs.com/> so you can share it with anyone. Just hit
the "Publish" in the preview window:

![](/assets/old-blog-stuff/publish.png)

Like gists, documents at <http://rpubs.com/> can be updated and easily
shared and accept comments.

Git is also built into the Rstudio interface. Saving a version of your
software is as easy as clicking a button. This makes the git learning
curve a little easier:

![](/assets/old-blog-stuff/gitexample.png)

Finally, the latest version of Rstudio has package creation tools based
on the `devtools` package, including tools for testing and documenting
packages. Like its Git interface, RStudio's package development tools
make the process of package creation more intuitive:

![](/assets/old-blog-stuff/buildexample.png)

[Interactive R with Shiny](#TOC)
--------------------------------

A relatively new and exciting way to use R to share data analysis is
[Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/). Shiny is an R package that lets
you create *interactive* web pages that let users explore your data and
analysis. Here's an example. Click on it to go to the interactive
version:

[![](/assets/old-blog-stuff/shinyexample.png)](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/)

[Upcoming tools for real-time, interactive and collaborative programming](#TOC)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the next year or so we will likely see tools for live, interactive
coding that allow you to collaborate in real time on R scripts the way
Google Docs allows such collaboration with documents.
<https://www.stypi.com> is one such tool, though it doesn't have
R-specific options yet. Yihui Xie, the creator of `knitr` has created an
[interactive notebook](http://glimmer.rstudio.com/yihui/knitr/) based on
Shiny and `knitr` which runs your knitr/R code on the web, but it is
just a proof-of-concept. Look out for new developments!

[Engaging with R Communities Online](#TOC)
------------------------------------------

If you are looking for peers and collaborators in your work with R,
there are a lot of places online to do so.

**Listservs:**In addition the listservs mentioned above, there are many
[specialty listservs](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html) for specific
platforms and applications, and [local user
groups](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/local-r-groups.html). Many
packages have listservs associated with them, too, where users can ask
question and get information about the latest updates. If you are
learning how to use a new package it's helpful to sign up for these.

**Blogs**: [R-bloggers](r-bloggers.com) is a great website that
aggregates many blogs by people who use R. Blogs range from people
writing *about* R (e.g., tutorials), to people blogging *with* R (e.g.,
`knitr` documents of their latest analyses). Following the site feed
will help you discover other people doing work similar to yours.

**Twitter**: If you're on twitter, the
[\#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats) hashtag is commonly
used to discuss R, and you can often get answers to short questions very
quickly. Many of developers of R packages and software are on twitter,
so you can get information straight from the source.

**Code Hosting Sites**: Many R package developers host their projects on
websites like [Github](https://github.com/languages/R) and
[R-forge](http://r-forge.r-project.org/). These sites have mechanisms
for users to report bugs, make feature requests, and often find more
information than is available in the documentation of a specific
package. You can often find the site used by a developer by looking at
it's entry on
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)
or the package revewing site [crantastic](http://crantastic.org/).
