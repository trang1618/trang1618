<p>In the last Quaker Strong challenge in the spring (March Madness edition), I was competing with several friends and enjoyed seeing how they were doing with the challenge.
However, this time, with 46 registered participants, I figured it might be fun to write a few lines of code and make some fun visualization out of the logged progress.</p>
<p>Code and details can be found <a href="https://github.com/trang1618/quaker-strong-2019">here</a>.
To protect the participants’ identity, I have randomly mapped the alpha Steem monsters from a <a href="https://github.com/effofex/monster_ordination/blob/master/data/cardlist.csv">cardlist.csv</a> to their names.
Only participants with the google sheet URL are able to reproduce these figures.</p>
<p>I’ll let you interpret the visualizations yourself.
Enjoy!</p>
