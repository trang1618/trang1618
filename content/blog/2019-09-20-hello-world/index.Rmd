[Penn Genetics](https://www.med.upenn.edu/genetics/) recently held a wonderful retreat at [Bear Creek Moutain resort](https://www.bcmountainresort.com/).
I enjoyed the many wonderful scientific talks at the retreat, but I was most moved by [Arjun Raj](http://rajlaboratory.blogspot.com/)'s call to action: blog.{{%mn%}} At the retreat, Arjun also delivered a great talk on *How to give a talk*.{{%/mn%}}

I have always wanted to start a blog since graduate school when I read [Daniel Lakens' post](http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2017/04/five-reasons-blog-posts-are-of-higher.html) on why blog posts may have higher quality than scientific journals.{{%mn%}}I highly recommend you have a read.{{%/mn%}}
Personally, I think these posts are great for formalizing one's thoughts on scientific concepts or experiment ideas.
However, I feared that I needed to read a lot more before I write, and the lack of a personal website added to my hesitation.

A few days after the retreat, I stumbled upon [Noam Ross' newly created  site](http://noamross.net/) on twitter, and I fell in love!
The fonts, theme, basic Kube setups, Tufte design... everything I have ever wanted!
Well, almost everything.
The only thing I didn't love is Noam's choice of syntax highlighting, and his [lua filter](https://github.com/noamross/noamross.net/blob/5196414a79b7b1d64914a0a627c9fb5104656253/scripts/syntax-highlight-hugo.lua) also didn't quite work for me, so I removed this file and changed `_output.yml` to

```{yaml, eval = FALSE}
blogdown::html_page:
  highlight: tango
```

Now, this action creates another issue.
You see, this code adds to the generated .html *style* tags and everything in between 
```{html, eval = FALSE}
<style type="text/css">
[...]
</style>
```
which means Hugo `.Summary` is now filled with nonsense such as 

> a.sourceLine { display: inline-block; line-height: 1.25; }.

I try to strip out this *style* chunk with `replaceRE` and `plainify` in my `layouts/section/blog.html`, [but that didn't work](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3235).
Finally, Yihui Xie's [post](https://yihui.name/en/2017/08/hugo-post-summary/#fn:Why-Scratch-Beca) on how to generate a Hugo summary came to the rescue.{{%mn%}}Why didn't I look for Yihui's advice in the first place?!{{%/mn%}}
Following Yihui's guide gets me very close but still not quite what is expected.
Finally, 林志扬's incredible insight saves the day.

> I suggest using `(.|\n)*?` instead of `.*?` when searching for paragraph contents, since a single line break won't start a new paragraph.

I probably should not have spent this much time on syntax highlighting, but I desperately wanted *some* highlighting.
And yes, I do need a crash course on regular expression.

Here's to the beginning of something new, a personal website that I'm, at the moment, very excited about.
With or without scientific content, I hope to keep the blog updated with my musings.
And who knows, I may be able use some material I write here for my scientific outputs (given the journal permits citations of blogposts).
