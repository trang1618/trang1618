      <description>*This week at the [Davis R Users&#39; Group](http://www.noamross.net/davis-r-users-group.html) we had a great presentation by Kara Moore O&#39;Leary on using the [`popbio` package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/popbio/) to examine rare plant demographics. The following is her script run through `knitr`. You can download the original script and associated data [here](https://gist.github.com/noamross/bf8ebdcf42fd2e0851a8). Find out more about Kara and her work at her website [here](http://dynamicecosciences.wordpress.com/)* Demographic analysis using the popbio library and some other fun stuff ---------------------------------------------------------------------- **A population viability type analysis for a rare herbacious perennial plant, *Penstemon albomarginatus*, for its only remaining California population** Objectives: 1) Estimating the population growth rate - deterministic and stochastic methods 2) Sensitivity and elasticity analysis - which transitions/rate are most variable, sensitive to change 3) Projecting the population stochastically for different scenarios, observing variation in growth rate 4) Quasi extinction probability 5) Estimating vital rates from real data, which will never be as good/much the data that you would like to have for a PVA - some therapy for me, and maybe you too Load popbio and some other helpful libraries.</description>

      <description>Last week in [Davis R Users&#39; Group](http://www.noamross.net/davis-r-users-group.html), Lauren Yamane showed us how she created and analyzed a stochastic age-structured population in R. Her examples are below. Her original scripts can be found as `*.Rmd` files [here](https://gist.github.com/4197507) A note to UC Davis students: This topic and others will be covered by Marissa Baskett and Sebastian Schreiber in their course this winter, *Computational methods in population biology* (ECL298) * * * * * A discrete time, age-structured model of a salmon population (semelparous) that can live to age 5, with fishing and environmental stochasticity ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Parameter values ~~~~ {.</description>
