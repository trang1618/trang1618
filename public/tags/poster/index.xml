      <description> For the past week I&#39;ve been at the [Mathematical Biosciences Institute](http://mbi.osu.edu/) at Ohio State, attending the [Workshop on Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources](http://mbi.osu.edu/2013/ws3description.html). It&#39;s been an absolutely top-notch meeting. I need to get myself to more of these small workshops. I brought a poster describing some of my work in progress on managing Sudden Oak Death. Here it is, and it&#39;s archived over at [Figshare](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.833911).  </description>

      <description>I&#39;m pretty pleased that my IGERT team&#39;s work has garnered both Judge&#39;s Choice and Community Choice awards in the [IGERT video and poster competition](http://posterhall.org/igert2012/posters/306). IGERT [(Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship)](http://www.igert.org/) is a National Science Foundation program to foster interdisciplinary research at the graduate level. Here at UC Davis, [our team](http://reach.ucdavis.edu/people/trainees.html) includes ecologists and a historian, and we have been looking at how floodplain restoration can be shaped by both bioeconomic constraints and historical legacies.</description>
