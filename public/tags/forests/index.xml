      <description>[Mason Earles](http://jmearles.net/) gave a great presentation this week at [Davis R Users&#39; Group](http://www.noamross.net/davis-r-users-group.html) about linking R with the [Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS)](http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/). FVS is a model developed by the US Forest Service to simulate forest growth over time. It&#39;s written in FORTRAN and has been around since the 1970s. FVS has recently gone open-source (its [repository is on google code](http://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/)), and now has [an alpha-level API which can be called from R](http://code.</description>

      <title>Quals Reading: Four Reviews of Forest Epidemiology</title>

      <description>Here&#39;s the first of my quals reading summaries, this landscape forest
pathology. [David Rizzo](http://ucanr.org/sites/rizzolab/) will be
examining me on this topic.

Summary
-------

Much of our knowledge of pathology is at the organismal level
(host-pathogen interactions), but actual management occurs at stand,
forest, and regional levels. To understand and manage forest diseases at
this scale, we need appropriate epidemiological and landscape ecology
tools and frameworks.</description>

      <description>My qualifying exams are on March 5, 2013. 78 days away! I&#39;ll be trying
to blog my reading as well as the development of my proposal here and in
a [github repository](http://github.com/noamross/openquals). Today - my
topics and reading list.

      <description>This is a description of the model I&#39;ve implemented in the [SODDr
package](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2012/11/16/sod-dynamics-1.html),
which I prepared for a presentation for the Hastings lab meeting on
November 29, 2012.

Background
----------

[Sudden Oak Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_oak_death) (SOD)
is a disease that threatens tanoak populations in California. It&#39;s cause
is an introduced pathogen, *Phytophthora ramorum*. *Phytophthora* is a
water mold that spreads by wind-blown rain and fog as well as through</description>

      <description>This week I pinged the Davis Forest Biology Students&#39; Association and my
twitter friends for recommendations for forest-specific journals. Here
are their responses:

-   **[Forest Ecology and
    Management](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03781127)**
-   **[Canadian Journal of Forest
    Research](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/journal/cjfr)**
-   [Journal of Forestry](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/saf/jof)
-   [Tropical
    Ecology](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=TRO)
    (not forest specific, but heavy on tropical forest research)</description>

      <title>Regime Shifts in Forest Ecosystems</title>

      <description>As I begin to put together material for my thesis proposal, I&#39;m
collecting literature on regime shifts in forest ecosystems. I&#39;m
interested in the time scale of regime shifts, and how they compare with
the time scale of stand dynamics (typically decades), which are the
dominant time scale in forestry economics.

Here is a preliminary set of examples and citations. I&#39;ve also created a
