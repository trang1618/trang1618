      <description>Many ecological processes are best represented by individual-based
models (IBMs), where processes at the scale of individual scale of
organisms and their actions are modeled explicitly. Such processes can
pose a problem for management or control; our observational scale,
control levers, or management goals may be limited to coarser scales
than the individual.

IBMs suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The number of possible
states of the system, which consists of the possible states and</description>

      <description>My examiner on theoretical ecology, [Marissa
Baskett](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/baskett/), suggested that I
return to some basic literature on the *why* of mathematical modeling in
ecology. Here are notes on three papers:

Summary
-------

-   Modeling *purpose* must be clearly defined, as this determines
    whether to focus on generality, realisms, and/or precision
-   Complexity is as often obfuscating as illuminating</description>
