      <description>In [my first pass at text analysis of the ESA program](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2014/7/24/esacorpuscompare.html), I looked at how the frequency of words used in the ESA program differed from last year to this year. There are much more sophisticated ways at looking at word use in text, though, and I began to dive into the text-mining literature to find other ways to draw insight from ESA abstracts. One method I found is *topic modeling* using [latent Dirichlet allocation](http://en.</description>

      <description>After my [last post](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2014/7/24/esacorpuscompare.html) text-mining [ESA Annual Meeting](http://esa.org/am/) abstracts, [Nash Turley](http://www.nashturley.org/) [was interested](https://twitter.com/NashTurley/status/495272858038595587) in the presence of the term &#34;natural history&#34; in ESA abstracts. I decided to collect a little more data by including programs back to 2010, giving a five-year data set. Thankfully the program back to 2010 remains in mostly the same format, so it&#39;s easy to pull the data for these additional years. Now, not all talks that include natural history concepts will include the term &#34;</description>

      <description>[ESA](http://esa.org/am/) is just around the corner, and many of us are
gearing up and trying to figure out a
[schedule](http://eco.confex.com/eco/2014/schedule/index.cgi) to cover
all the talks and people we can pack in. ESA is a big conference and
there&#39;s far too much for any one person to see. In the end, everyone
experiences a [different part of the
elephant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant).
However, I thought it would be interesting to take a look at the big</description>

      <description>I just submitted the abstract below to the [ESA 2014 meeting](http://www.esa.org/sacramento/). Can&#39;t wait! I&#39;m also organizing an oral session with [Richard Cobb](https://sites.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/richard-cobb/): &#34;[Ecosystem and Community Effects of Native and Invasive Diseases](http://esa.org/am/organizedorals/#id2743).&#34; Click through for more details. It&#39;s gonna be a good year! I haven&#39;t been to ESA since 2008.  ### Modeling forest disease using a macroparasite framework   Noam Ross, UC Davis Graduate Group in Ecology   **Background/Question/Methods:**   Forest pathogens are typically modeled using variants of *SI* models,  in which the infection states of trees are binary.</description>
