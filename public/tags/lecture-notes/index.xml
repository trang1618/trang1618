      <description>Papers discussed: Gordon (1954), @Hardin1966, Scott (1955), Smith (1968) Gordon was a labor economist who was interested in why Eastern Canada was poor despite the abundant ocean resources. At the time, work by Beverton and Holt and others was producing very sophisticated *biological* fishery models. Gordons model of fish growth was: $$\dot{X}_t = a-bX_t - H_t$$ which was a linear rather than quadratic model with harvesting. The harvest rate was proportional to effort/capital $K_t$ and the biomass and catchability $q$ $$H_t = qK_tX_t$$ In steady state: $$X_{ss}[qK_s b] = a,\, X_{ss} = \frac{a}{b qK_{ss}} $$ With prices ($p$) and cost per unit effort ($w$) fixed, $$TR_{ss} = pqX_{ss}K_{ss} = \frac{apqK_{ss}}{b qK_{ss}}$$ $$TC_{ss} = wK_{ss}$$ !</description>
