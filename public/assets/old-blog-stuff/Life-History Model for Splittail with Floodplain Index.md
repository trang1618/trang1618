<h1 id="approach">Approach</h1>
<ul>
<li>Combine two existing models - annual floodplain habitat index, and life-history model from Moyle et al. <span class="citation">(2004)</span></li>
<li>Move from “wet year” and “dry year” in Moyle et al. <span class="citation">(2004)</span> to continuous floodplain habitat</li>
<li>Floodplain habitat index modifies the number of YOY splittail produced, via the probability of adult spawning, the probability of spawning in suitable habitat, and the survivorship of the young.</li>
<li>Split each year of adults into those that spawned the previous year and those that haven’t, with one that previously spawned providing zero new fecundity. Probability of entering the “spawned” class is \(P_{spawn}\), a function of floodplan habitat.</li>
<li>Create linear functions between floodplain habitat and \(P_{spawn}\) and YOY recruitment by using values from Moyle et al. <span class="citation">(2004)</span> model for “wet”, “normal”, and “dry” years.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things to examine:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does annual floodplain habitat index vary with other measures of wet/dry years?</li>
<li>How does the project configuration modify this relationship?</li>
</ul>
