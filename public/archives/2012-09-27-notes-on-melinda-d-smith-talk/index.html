-   Melinda's general framework: Ecological implications of global
    change. How human caused global changes (climate, biochemical
    modification, land use), ultimately change community structure and
    function.
-   Grasslands (inc. steppe, tundra, savanna, and scrublands) cover 40%
    of earth's surface. Sequester large amounts of C, economically
    important for grazing, house most remaining megafauna
-   Shaped by climate variability, both directly and indirectly through
    grazing and fire. All these regimes are being modified by humans.
    -   Increased fire frequency
    -   Timing, location, and intensity of grazing.
    -   Big question: can we generalize findings about these effects
        across grasslands?

-   Focus of this talk is *savannah grasslands*: mesic savannah, where
    rain is \>500mm/yr, and C4 grasses dominate
-   Some argue fire and grazing affect ecosystem structure/function in
    *fundamentally different ways* across different grasslands
-   How are S. African grasslands different than North American?
    -   Scholes et al. (2003) argued that the systems are different
    -   SA grasslands have longer evolutionary history due to no
        glaciation events
    -   They have lower soil fertility
    -   Greater large herbivore and plant diversity

-   Big questions:
    -   Can we forecast impacts?
    -   Are differences between knowledge of systems based on different
        approaches by scientists?
    -   Are impacts differences between the systems?

-   Take a comparative approach
-   Manipulate fire and grazing
-   Study sights
    -   Two long-term experiments: Konza Prairie LTER, Kruger Nat'l Park

-   Comparison
    -   Similar biomass response to precipitation
    -   Similar tree/shrub/grass balance
    -   Elephants in S. African site, no equivalent in N. America
    -   Fire key control on woody plants
    -   Question: What about the *herbaceous plant community?*
    -   Differences: Soil nutrients, temperature, herbivore richness,
        but similar in when rainfall comes.
    -   Not comparing apples to oranges, *orchards to orchards*

-   Overarching hypothesis: *Fire and grazing will be broadly
    **convergent** in their effects on **ecosystem processes**, but the
    **plant community responses** will **diverge***
    -   Why? C4 grasses dominate both, but in SA there is much more
        diversity due to older system (@Scholes2003a)

-   Experiments
    -   Removed large herbivores using 40m^2^ exclosures
    -   Used existing 1, 3-4, and never-burn treated areas
    -   n=63

-   Results
    -   Divergence in plant community response. In SA, community is
        richer in unburned than in 1-yr communities. No effect in N.
        America. Similar overall plant diversity. But on 2-m^2^ scale,
        SA plots are less diverse due to lower spatial turnover
    -   Response to fire and grazing together.
        -   Rapid decline in richness in exclosures in N. America
        -   In SA, decline was lagged an occurred inly in the absence of
            fire

    -   In N. America, only grazing affected plant group composition. In
        SA, only fire affected it.
    -   For NA, compositional differences driven by reduced abundance of
        a few C3 species.
    -   For SA, it was due to turnover of dominant species and (C4 and
        legumes)

-   No difference between the systems in terms of NPP. Both continued to
    be driven mostly by annual precipitation.
-   Unexpected findings
-   Differences between fire/herbivore interactions:
    -   In NA, the fire-grazing interactions arises become one species
        dominate irrespective of fire regime Bison graze these out. See
        Collins (1998).
    -   Magnitude and speed of plant community response was much greater
        in NA than in SA.\

-   How to think about this?
-   Hierarchy of mechanisms expected to differentially drive community
    and ecosystem change with removal of grazing:
    -   individual response --\> species re-ordering --\> species
        migration

-   Differences in grazing *intensity* does not appear to be driving
    different responses. Similar levels found in both systems.
-   Future directions
-   Phylogenetic analysis (work by colleague)
    -   So far, found significant clade overlap but no species overlap
    -   Only in SA do we see differences among clades in fire response

-   This comparison suggests generalzation may be easier to do at the
    ecosystem level, but not at the community level. If we understand
    the relationship between those two scales, we'll have a better
    handle on prediction.

### Q & A

-   What relevant traits should we be measuring?
    -   Still figuring this out, but currently looking at nutrient
        content, tensile strength, root/shoot ratio, traits thought to
        be related to fire and grazing

-   What are management implications?
    -   Aiming to provide managers with info to explain how they might
        modify composition/diversity and still maintain functions they
        want. Also, understanding fire frequencies that maintain
        diversity

-   How does the historical temporal/spatial distribution of fire
    compare to managed fires?
    -   Definite differences. Fire was much more patchy in the past, and
        at much larger scales. We've simplified the system. Return
        interval *is* thought to be 3-4 years in both NA and SA.

-   Would NA behave more like SA if we had the same herbivore
    assemblage?
    -   Probably not, because of the differences in plant community and
        diversity
